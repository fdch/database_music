=head1 NAME

List::SomeUtils::XS - XS implementation for List::SomeUtils

=head1 VERSION

version 0.53

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are no user-facing parts here. See L<List::SomeUtils> for API details.

You shouldn't have to install this module directly. When you install
L<List::SomeUtils>, it checks whether your system has a compiler. If it does,
then it adds a dependency on this module so that it gets installed and you
have the faster XS implementation.

This distribution requires L<List::SomeUtils> but to avoid a circular
dependency, that dependency is explicitly left out from the this
distribution's metadata. However, without LSU already installed this module
cannot function.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<List::Util>, L<List::AllUtils>

=head1 DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at L<http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html>.
