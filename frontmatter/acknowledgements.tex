I would like to thank my advisor, Jaime Oliver La Rosa, for his role in inspiring this project, as well as his commitment to research, clarity, and academic rigor. I am also indebted to committee members Martin Daughtry and Elizabeth Hoffman, for their ongoing guidance and support even at the very early stages of this project, and William Brent and Robert Rowe, whose insightful, thought-provoking input made this dissertation come to fruition. I am also everlastingly grateful to Judy Klein, for always being available to listen and share her listening. As well as to Aye, for her endless support and her helping me maintain hope in developing this project. I would also like to thank my parents, Ana and Hector, who inspired and nurtured my interest in music from a young age, and my sister Flor and my brother Joaquin who were always with me, next to every word. Finally, this dissertation could not have been possible without the support and help of my friends, some of which I would like to mention by name because they affected directly certain aspects of this text. I would like to thank Matias Delgadino and Lucia Simonelli, for their continuous layers of abstraction; Matias Borg Oviedo, for those endless conversations; Ioannis Angelakis, for his glass sculptures.
