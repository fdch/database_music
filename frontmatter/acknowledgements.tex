I would like to thank my advisor, David Ledesma, for his role in inspiring this project, as well as his commitment to introspection, and to reflecting upon and exploring meaningful issues in clinical psychology. I am also indebted to committee members John Hilaire and Michael Douglas for their ongoing guidance and support, as well as their frequent feedback (often in the
form of exceedingly prompt email responses), at every stage of this project. This dissertation could not have come to fruition without the help of Del Aware and Barney Rubble, who offered balanced yet insightful, thought-provoking input. I am also everlastingly grateful to Jill Pullman, for always being available to listen and empathize, as well as to my husband John Doe, for his endless tolerance and his helping me maintain hope that I would indeed finish this project! I would also like to thank my parents, Paul
and Mary Williamson, who inspired and nurtured my interest in observation and clinical judgement from a very young age. Finally, many thanks to all of the undergraduates who so patiently offered their time and clinical judgements.
