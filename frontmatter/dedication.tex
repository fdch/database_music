For my mother and father, who have always taught me to never give up with my research, even during the most difficult times. Also to my advisor, Jaime Oliver La Rosa, without his help and continuous guidance, this would have never been possible. For Elizabeth Hoffman and Judy Klein, who always believed in me, and whose words and music I bring everywhere. Finally to Aye, whose love I cannot even begin to describe.
