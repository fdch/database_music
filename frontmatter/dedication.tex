For my mother and father, who have always taught me to never give up with my research, even during the most difficult times. Also to my advisor, Jaime Oliver, without his help and continuous guidance, this would have never been possible. Finally to my loving wife, Aye, whose love and support helped me make it through the sleepless evenings.
