\paragraph{Community as unwork}
As I have described above, for Nancy, a resonant self (self, from now on) is made of ``the singular occurrences of a state, a tension, or, precisely, a `sense''' \parencite[8]{Nan07:Lis}. Since these occurrences are in a permanent state of occurring, that is, never fixated in a whole (in `tension'), we can understand singular beings as being `interrupted' or `suspended.' These descriptions come from an earlier text \textcite{Nan91:The}, in which he extends this definition of the self to the definition of a community: ``community is made of the interruption of singularities, or of the suspension that singular beings are'' \parencite[31][All subsequent quotes from this passage.]{Nan91:The}. This is why we can understsand `community' as ontological (grounded on a nature of being), and not as teleological (grounded on a purpose or an objective). In other words, if community is thought of as a product of the work of `selves' (teleologically), it follows that selves could also become the product of community.

}{Community as work}

Nancy thus underscores that ``community is not the work of singular beings, nor can it claim them as its works'' \fsee{work}. Since community is ontological, Nancy understands it as the being of singular beings ``suspended upon its limit.'' Therefore, within this ontology of community, how is it possible for us to speak of the `work' of `selves' and of community if `work' is something that does not enter into its definition? Furhtermore, how is the concept of the work of art redefined or framed within this ontology? Nancy's conclusion is that community can never result out of `work,' but it is something that unfolds as `unworking.' Borrowing from Maurice Blanchot's concept of \textit{desoevrement}, Nancy proposes `unworking' or `inoperativity' as a way to understand `work' within an ontology of community.\footnote{The symmetry of this teleology of work also relates to communication. Understood as the being in common of singularities: ``communication is the unworking of work that is social, economic, technical, and institutional \parencite[31]{Nan91:The}. I am tempted here to suggest that it communication, in this sense, is also the unworking of work that is resonant.} `Unwork' is work withdrawing from itself: ``that which before or beyond the work, withdraws from the work.'' That is to say, Nancy points to a moment in which operativity separates from itself, and by that gesture, it distinguishes itself from both production and from a whole, or a finished product: ``no longer having to do either with production or with completion, encounters interruption, fragmentation, suspension'' \fsee{unwork}. Is this not the resonance of a return? Work returning as the interrupted resonance of its own unworking?

\paragraph{At the Limit}
Nancy's concept of community can be recognized within his later and broader concept of `resonance.' Given the fact that Nancy's ontology of sound points to the distance or the interval between sense and signification, and thus, to the emergence of a resonant subject during the sonorous presence, this distance can be thought of as suspended at a limit. We can think of this limit as an edge in the resonant network that, in Nancy's terms, exposes selves to themselves and to one another.

Further, Nancy provides us with an essential insight, suggesting that ``it is not obvious that the community of singularities is limited to `man' and excludes, for example, the `animal''' \parencite[28]{Nan91:The}. Therefore, by understanding resonant networks in terms of community we can speak of an exposure of selves, or a self-exposure, between humans and nonhumans in a liminality can be thought of as a skin: ``a singular being \textit{appears}, as finitud itself: at the end (or at the beginning), with the contact of the skin (or the heart) of another singular being\dots'' \parencite[28]{Nan91:The}. This skin (or heart) makes at least two references, one to the affective presence of the body in relation to touch, and another to the finitud that singular beings are, that is, what (for Nancy) is the being in common of beings: their life, but fundamentally, their death. First, with this latter reference, we can depart a bit from Nancy's `skin,' and stretch it away from this living/nonliving distinction altogether. Latour's ontological hybrid can thus enter into the considerations I am proposing here: ``an actor-network is an entity that does the tracing and the inscribing. It is an ontological definition and not a piece of inert matter in the hands of others, especially of human planners or designers. It is in order to point out this essential feature that the word `actor' was added to it'' \parencite[7]{Lat90:On}. Therefore, what is in common along the network is not finitud in terms of death, but in terms of the very condition of liminality itself: actor-network at the limit.

\paragraph{Infralanguage}
Latour considers that the descriptive project in \gls{ant} does not compose a metalanguage with which to define overarching explanations. Instead, \gls{ant} searches for explications by retaining ``only a very few terms ---its \textit{infra}language--- which are just enough to sail in between frames of reference'' \im \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}. On the one hand, with this infralanguage \gls{ant} arrives at an ``empty frame for describing how any entity builds its world'' \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}. That is to say, it is a descriptive project focused on ``meaning-production,'' that is, creating associations and connections. On the other hand, with this infralanguage \gls{ant} ``grants back to the actors themselves the ability to build precise accounts of one another by the very way they behave'' \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}. That is to say, precisely by disarticulating the search for `overarching' explanations by means of a \textit{meta}language (\textit{the} key to open \textit{the} door), this infralanguage is a keychain (of tiny keys) that opens many doors for the new ``ontological hybrid'' that is the actor-network, because it is what allows actors themselves to build their own account, that is, their own world: ``world making entities'' \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}.

\paragrapn{Infraskin}
Unlike in Latour's network, affectivity appears in Nancy's `sense,' that is, on the body, its touch, and as before, in listening. \gls{ant} quite literally forbids this, treating any ``homogenous morphism'' as ``exceptions which should be accounted for'' \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}. That is to say, if we may think of a skin upon which we (humans) resonate in self-exposure (community as unwork), then this skin must be an exception, because it is only human, or animal, or reduced to living entities with affective bodies. However, perhaps we can ``account for'' this skin as exceptional, and consider it ``x-morphic,'' that is, ``anthropo-morphic, but also zoo-morphic, phusi-morphic, logo-morphic, techno-morphic, ideo-morphic'' \parencite[16]{Lat90:On}. This x-morphic skin is what we (humands and nonhumans) have in common as singular beings in the network, what for Nancy is ``at the confines of the \textit{same} singularity'' \parencite[28]{Nan91:The} would be at the irreducible limit of an `infra' skin. Nancy is aware the this skin is not a total, complete, or superior skin:\footnote{For Nancy ``there is no communion of singularities in a totality superior to them and immanent to their common being'' \parencite[28]{Nan91:The}.} like selves and community, it is interrupted. Interruption, however, in Latour's terminology relates to an ethics of the network where `good' and `bad' are understood in terms of navigation, mediation, and reduction. More connectivity is good, less is bad: ``either an account leads you to all the other accounts\dots or it interrupts constantly the movement, letting frames of reference distant and foreign\dots'' \parencite[13-14]{Lat90:On}. Nevertheless, we can understand interruptedness as a general condition of irreducibility, which is, contradictorily enough ``the highest ethical standard for \gls{ant} \parencite[14]{Lat90:On}. In being interrupted, the relation itself becomes ontological, since it is thus the unworking of the work of actors. The new `ontological hybrid' actor-network can be understood, then, as comprised of te \textit{unwork} of actors. This is the suspension at the limit: within the irreducibility of this interruptedness, this infraskin is simultaneously ``always \textit{other}, always shared, always exposed'' \parencite[28]{Nan91:The}. Like the skin of the Silent Drum Controller \see{applications:hybrid_queries}, suspended along the rims, stretching and compressing to touch, and making mechanical waves through the resonances of its silence, this infraskin would resonate at the limit. The Slient Drum tracks shapes made with the elastic fabric folding and unfolding against the human skin, therefore it ``acts as the limits, but also as an extension of the human body'' \parencite[2]{DBLP:conf/icmc/OliverJ08}. I would interject here, and propose that instead of an ``extension of the human body'', the Silent Drum can be thought of as extending Latour's network \textit{with} the body, and its affectivity. In this sense, this skin is not a layer that separates the interior form the exterior of a body, or a surface under which or over which two selves can connect. This skin is not a surface, but it can be thought of as a texture; not a layer, but an interweaving of elastic fibers \fsee{expand} that, in their own locality are fragile, but due to the reticulated structure expands into a redundancy of fragilities. And we can listen to it.








Within this quality of incompleteness, which relates to suspension, but also to fracture, instability, and unpredictability, 

that prevents concepts such as unity, concentration, or purity, to enter into the picture. 



``for the deployment of as many elements as possible accounted for through as many metalanguages as possible''

(A process which composes itself as process), 


In the network model, the nodes within the network are connected and associated to each other, that is, the `work' of agents in Latour's terminology. As I describe earlier, Latour's network encompasses the human and the nonhuman: 

Agency, therefore, is what is in common across all nodes. However, a crucial distinction appears if we understand this agency as a form of `networking,' that is, as the way this web of associations and connections works: 
In other words, consider the graph that I include here \fsee{work}. 

``The notion of network allows us to lift the tyranny of social theorists and to regain some margin of manoeuvers between the ingredients of society ---its vertical space, its hierarchy, its layering, its macro scale, its wholeness, its overarching character--- and how these features are achieved and which stuff they are made of'' \parencite[5]{Lat90:On}.


``. This is not to say that there is nothing like “macro” society, or “outside” nature as the AT is often accused to, but that in order to obtain the effects of distance, proximity, hierarchies, connectedness, outsiderness and surfaces, an enormous supplementary work has to be done. This work however is not captured by the topological notion of network no matter how sophisticated we wish to make it.'' \parencite[6]{Lat90:On}

The resistance of the skin represents, thus, the resistance of connectivity itself, that is, the resistance of a community.

Therefore, by substituting, on one hand, the human with the database performer (databaser) and, on the other, the nonhuman with the database, the resonant network, as an instantiation of a process of unworking, enables the thought of a \textit{database community} to emerge. 

In a database community, database music can be understood as a hybridly social and communicative event. 

This is to say that, following Latour's hybridity of objects in his understanding of society \parencite[2]{Lat90:On}, database music is a social practice that comes as a result of databasers and databases in resonance with each other. 

% Can you give examples? 
% how do they resonate in practice?

Furthermore, database music is an instance of community, 

% this suggests that

% shouldn't database music be a community event instead per your earlier definition?

in the sense that it is an event of communication, understanding the communicative as ``the unworking of work that is social, economic, technical, and institutional'' \parencite[31]{Nan91:The}. 

% What this means is that …. explain in lay terms the “unworking of work”...

Therefore, the database community emerges as the unworking of databasers and databases. 

Database community can be considered as, precisely, the skin
