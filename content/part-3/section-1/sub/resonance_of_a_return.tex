	To be listening is thus to enter into tension and to be on the lookout for a relation to self: \textit{not} it should be emphasized, a relationship to `me' (the supposedly given subject), or to the `self' or the other (the speaker, the musician, also supposedly given, with his subjectivity), but to the \textit{relationship in self}, so to speak, as it forms a `self' or a `to itself' in general, and if something like that ever does reach the end of its formation. Consequently, listening is passing over to the register of presence to self, it being understood that the `self' is precisely nothing available (substantial or subsistent) to which one can be `present,' but precisely the resonance of a return [\textit{renvoi}]. \parencite[12]{Nan07:Lis}

\paragraph{Sonorous presence}
Jean-Luc Nancy \parencite{Nan07:Lis} brings forth an ontology of sound that is based on the performativity of listening. Linking an embodied theory of listening with a phenomenology of the self, this ontology begins by defining the `sonorous presence.' For Brian Kane \parencite{Gra15:The}, Nancy's `sonorous presence' is given by the combination of both the listening body as being part of the medium and the body's sense perception linked to that medium. I understand medium here as the transmission medium upon which sound propagates, such as a space filled with gas, liquid, or solid particles of matter. Under this definition, all bodies are part of media, that is, both human and nonhuman bodies. Sound reaches, enters, and traverses bodies within media. Thus, for Nancy, sound immerses all bodies within itself. This means that sound includes all bodies within its oscillation, making listeners vibrate. Therefore, the listening subject, understood as the one that is listening (a singular listener) is always already part of sound. 

\paragraph{An a priori filter}
In being already part of sound, bodies change sound even before listening. On a mechanical level, the body is an a priori physical filter. Sound is filtered differently and uniquely within each body: my body changes the incoming sound for me, just as well it does for others. For instance, a longitudinal wave passing through a body affects how it will arrive at other points in space. Sound propagation is conditioned by the qualities of the medium. That is to say, while the combination of density, pressure, temperature, and motion affect its speed, viscosity within media affects its attenuation rate. This means that within hot and humid climates sound will move slower, and if there is wind blowing in the same direction of a sound it will travel faster. What is important here, is that this also means the listening body changes how sound moves both inside and outside of itself. On the one hand, bodies filter sounds towards one another. On the other, even before longitudinal waves reach the tympan, the same body already affects their movement. Waves change direction by way of reflection or refraction, and they fade out by way of attenuation. This means that waves are affected in different ways according to different media, some being more (concert halls) or less reflective (anechoic chambers). Since the listener's body itself refracts, reflects, and attenuates waves, the singular filter that is the body changes wave propagation not only for itself and its own listening experience, also for the listening experience of other subjects in different places in space. This explains why empty concert halls sound more reverberant than filled concert halls.

\paragraph{Sonorous presence in an attack}
Sonorous presence, therefore, can be understood as follows. Since listeners are singularities in the presence of sound, and since sound itself is the singularly exposed presence, the sonorous presence is an exposition of an in-between-ness, or a resonant state of a self being exposed to itself and to one another. The experience of this exposure, however, points to the presence of sound as a sensing experience in itself (the body listening to itself listen), and not to what a given sound might signify. As Kane writes, to be listening in the sonorous present constitutes ``a mode of listening that exposes itself to sense'' \parencite[143-144]{Gra15:The}. This means that in the sonorous present, the listening body emerges as a creation of itself as sense. Therefore, in the sonorous present the first image is that of the body. In this sense, the body is given form by itself: it is self-in-formed during the sonorous present. Furthermore, the duration of this sonorous presence is none other than an instant, or what Nancy refers to as an `attack.' All mechanical waves require an initial energy input. In the case of sound, particularly in musical contexts, this input is generally referred to as attack. Nancy, however, takes this notion of the attack to another plane. He refers to it as the exact moment when a sound arrives and simultaneously leaves the body: the instantaneous appearance of sound within the body. An attack therefore instantiates the sonorous presence.

\paragraph{Referrals and Deferrals}
The structure of the listening experience is one of infinite referrals and deferrals.\footnote{This structure comprises Nancy's reading of Jacques Derrida's concept of \textit{différance} and will be analyzed in the following section. For a commentary on this concept, see \parencite[71-72]{Gra15:The}; for Derrida's original essay on the matter, see \parencite{Der78:Wri,Der82:Mar}} Inasmuch as the sensing body is aware of its own multiplicity of sense, this multiplicity is itself dislocated spatially and temporally. Thus, the distances in both time and space, between all points of the listening experience, of the singular listener and the plurality of listeners, create a web of references that is instantiated in the attack of the sonorous presence. By way of listening, Nancy approaches the notion of meaning. That is to say, for him, meaning ``is made of a totality of referrals: from sign to a thing, from a state of things to a quality, from a subject to another subject or to itself, all simultaneously'' \parencite[4-9]{Nan07:Lis}. Therefore, since sound  ``is also made of referrals: it spreads in space, where it resounds while still resounding `in me'' \parencite[4-9]{Nan07:Lis}, the result is an understanding of listening as a process that intertwines sense and signification. As a consequence of meaning within the listening experience, the self comes along resounding, emerging out of a resonating plurality.

\paragraph{A Loop}
The condition of repetition, oscillation, or circularity explains the `infinite' quality that Nancy gives to the structure. To put this differently, the constant oscillatory motion that is present throughout the listening experience has the structure of a feedback circuit, or a loop. For example, I listen to myself as resonant subject, while creating meaning from a certain quality of a sound. I do this in simultaneity with another subject, who is also creating itself while giving meaning to other sound waves. In listening, the vibrating link in between ourselves is also simultaneously changing the way we are listening. Thus, every singularity is in a state of being exposed to one other, that is, in resonance or in touch with on other. Within this loop, not only sound enters and leaves the body, also the sensing body and the resonant self emerge and re-emerge infinitely. Therefore, this infinitude becomes the presence of the self, in the sense that the self becomes present to itself. 

\paragraph{An Approach to Self}
It is important to note that the self resonates to itself coming \textit{in}. This must be distinguished from the self understood as an expressive substance inherent to bodies, or already \textit{in} the body, as if it were some originary essence that appears out of resonance. Quite the contrary, for Nancy, the phenomenality of the self comes as a result of the resonance, in the form of a return. In other words, the self is something that appears to itself, at the limit of itself, very much like sound does. This is why, for Nancy, to be listening [\textit{être à l'écoute}] engages resonant subjects with an approach to self. This approach, however, is neither to the self, not to the self of another, but to the structure of resonance as understood in terms of a \textit{relationship in self} from itself. The quote at the beginning of this section (``if something like that ever does reach the end of its formation'') points precisely to the infinite resonant process with which Nancy builds his concept of listening, but specifically, it is how he sets forth an image of a self coming from this ontology of sound.\footnote{In this sense, Nancy is one of the first philosophers of the self to propose such a theorization of the self as resonance, extending his speculations to, for example, considering if the philosophical truth could be something listened to, as opposed to something seen: ``\dots shouldn't truth `itself,' as transitivity and incessant transition of a continual coming and going, be listened to rather than seen?'' \parencite[4]{Nan07:Lis}}
