This dissertation begins with a word, database, and a proposition: Is there something we can call database music? This sudden jump from noun to adjective comes not without its audible retaliation, and I make no attempt to muffle it. The reader would perhaps find it useful to know that my condition of composer has guided my research, and made me jump too quickly at the opportunity to make some sound in this initial gesture. Nevertheless, there is a sound and we can listen to it. %ambiguous, but this might be fine as you are introducing.


In the literature that I have mined (for this dissertation is not only a text, but the sedimented layers of text that I initially traversed with keywords in database queries, such as ``\texttt{database AND music}''), the database has many histories and many names attached to it. I make no attempt to cover all of these, but I admit that I have (foolishly) tried: the subtitle does begin \textit{``a history\dots.''} However, this is `a’ history and not `the’ history and thus there are gaps and missing parts to which this text is inevitably bound. It is also the `a' that accounts for the path that I begin delineating in the digital house (or database) that is this dissertation.

The two nodes that compose the focus of its text, \textit{database and music}, have each their own historical, technical, and aesthetic idiosyncrasies. The primary goal of this dissertation (if I dare to say that it has one) is thus to find where database and music intersect. The `\texttt{AND}' in our query had indeed much less results than the \texttt{OR}, which meant my quest was already promising some reduction. For instance, I decided that the search would only pertain to situations in which computers were involved (``with, perhaps, the exception of\dots'' \ref{lucierlude}). Needless to say, not only was my search dramatically expanded through the plethora of database applications, the history of their systematization, and the ongoing struggle between models, it also opened up the programming world, and with it the history of programming languages, and of the computer itself. Despite this broadening of the field, the conjugation `database music' narrowed down to computer based music practices, leaving out music made without (and also music made before) the emergence of computers.

% this is confusing, just say that these are important points or issues, but door number one is not precise.

Upon this abysmal enterprise, I did as any musician would and started listening for the sound of databases. I realized that this is not just the sound of your computer reading from its hard-drive: it is the sound made with its software. At this point, a network (and this is one of the key terms throughout this text) of sonic software had begun to appear. What this network pointed to, besides the key to open door number one, was a certain silence that much of the literature relating to databases in art continues to abide to: a sonic silence (a silence regarding sonic practices). This relates to the \textit{``history, technology\dots''} part of the subtitle. In addressing this silence, I do not attempt to invalidate previous approaches to theorizing database art \parencites{Man01:The}{Ves07:Dat}. On the contrary, these texts have shed light on the key concepts with which I have traversed the sonic software I present, the types of programming decisions I discuss, the various disciplines I place at the intersection of computers and music, and the plurality of shapes that have appeared in relation to databases: door number two. Through these authors, I introduce notions of embodiment, virtuality, and framing drawn from posthumanism \parencite{Hay99:How} and new media theory \parencite{Han04:New}, in order to contextualize the role of the database within the practices of \gls{mir}, Sonification, and Computer Music. Each one of these disciplines has its own history and it is evidenced by the many conference proceedings and journals that I have also mined, as well as the various authors (most of them composers, and most of them programmers) that I refer to. In between these two, that is, in between my exploration of the database in new media theory, and its corresponding exploration within sound practices, I introduce the more technical evolution of the database, in order to develop a secondary concept that speaks of the performativity of databases: \textit{databasing}. I use this non-existing gerund to refer to all the actions that need to take place around databases, whether these are made by humans or not, and referring to these users as \textit{databasers}.
% sorry the door metaphor sounds confusing, you can ignore me if you wish!

After having reached this point, in which the intersection of the database and music was covered in terms of its facticity, as the evidence of a motion, the trace of the database, I could not help but noticing door number three.  I attempted to connect database practices to theories of listening, memory, and networks outline a framework for discussing the aesthetic agency of database music. I began listening to a certain sound of networks, a certain resonance. This door refers to the next part of the subtitle ``\dots aesthetics of the database\dots'' and opened up to the complex world of sound, flipping this text horizontally: \texttt{music AND database}. (Bang!) The meaninglessness of this reversal, at least semantically or even in terms of a database query, became precisely the point. The sound of databases that I delineate through the first two doors now reached a point where it faced a difference. I enter first with \poscite{Nan07:Lis} ontology of sound, with which I understand the networks of music software as resonant networks. With this move, the database sounds as an actor \parencite{Lat90:On} that reconfigures the way we think communities \parencite{Nan91:The}. The implications of this association led me to distinguish databases, memory, and archives, and find within their connections a spectral form of authority \parencites{Der78:Wri}{Der95:Arc}. The final move extends towards the activity of the (human) body, and the relationship between database, gender, and performance \parencite{But88:Per}. These three nodes (resonance, spectrality, and performance) encompass an aesthetics of the database music that I plan only to suggest throughout this text, but that I will leave, to a certain extent, unexplained. \footnote{The reasons behind this artistic licence within the present academic text might perhaps come suggested from my condition of composer. However, this intentional suspension of my argument towards database music is grounded on the creative potentials that would otherwise be limited by an exhaustive account of the aesthetics in question. In other words, by advancing this threefold approach (resonance, spectrality, and performance) I suggest only one ---rather fragile--- way in which we can understand aesthetics within database music; the moment this aesthetics is defined to the fullest extent of its possibilities, it is when our creative duty as databasers becomes anchored to the framework of its definition. Thus, by providing the reader with only some aspects of this suspended or interrupted framework I suggest the reader to continue to explore these and other uncharted territories that database music proposes, and to traverse further thresholds that are yet unknown to this composer.}

Up to this point, my argument might seem to have arrived to an end: I contextualize and define database practices (chapter 1); I develop a technical overview of the performativity of the database into what I call databasing (chapter 2); I review the existing literature with emphasis on sound practices (chapter 3); I conceptualize sound in terms of resonance, networks, and community (chapter 4); I delineate the differences between database, memory, and archive, in order to present the spectrality of databases (chapter 5); I develop databasing in terms of performance, gender, and style in relation to databases (chapter 6). However, there is yet one more leap that the more adventurous reader might take with the final chapter of this dissertation. In chapter 7, I bring the discussion of database and music to the latter part of the subtitle \textit{``in music composition.''} With this chapter (a fourth door) I engage with the work of music composition. That is to say, with the history of the database in mind, I rethink the activity of composing \parencite{Vag01:Som}, the role of the composer \parencite{Lew99:Int}, and the operativity of the music work \parencite{Cas00:The}. The reader will be warned that this last chapter has no conclusions, let alone answers. Neither has it proper questions. It can be held as an attempt to incite, if anything, a provocation before the question.

I have already warned the reader about the aesthetic impulse of a composer writing a dissertation, but that should not discourage neither academic rigor, nor literary thirst. I have thus included an exhaustive bibliography, interludes, a transcription, and a postlude (work in progress), together with graphs, tables, a list of acronyms, a glossary, and some snippets of pseudocode and sometimes working code. In the hope that the content of this dissertation will open the discussion about the role of databases beyond their technical implementation and into their roles in musical aesthetics; and in the hope that you continue reading these p\{age,ixel\}s, I will (simply) \xout{draft an} end \xcancel{to} these introductory remarks.\footnote{This dissertation was made using \LaTeX{} and the Sublime Text editor.
