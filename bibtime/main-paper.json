    "abstract": "Querying Semi-Structured Data Serge Abiteboul ? INRIA-Rocquencourt Serge.Abiteboul\\@inria.fr 1 Introduction The amount of data of all kinds available electronically has increased dramatically in recent years. The data resides in different forms, ranging from unstructured data in file systems to highly structured in relational database systems. Data is accessible through a variety of interfaces including Web browsers, database query languages, application-specific interfaces, or data exchange formats. Some of this data is raw data, e.g., images or sound. Some of it has structure even if the structure is often implicit, and not as rigid or regular as that found in standard database systems. Sometimes the structure exists but has to be extracted from the data. Sometimes also it exists but we prefer to ignore it for certain purposes such as browsing. We call here semi-structured data this data that is (from a particular viewpoint) neither raw data nor strictly typed, i.e., not table-oriented as in a relational model or sorted-graph as in object databases. As will seen later when the notion of semi-structured data is more precisely defined, the need for semi-structured data arises naturally in the context of data integration, even when the data sources are themselves well-structured. Although data integration is an old topic, the need to integrate a wider variety of dataformats (e.g., SGML or ASN.1 data) and data found on the Web has brought the topic of semi-structured data to the forefront of research. The main purpose of the paper is to isolate the essential aspects of semistructured data. We also survey some proposals of models and query languages for semi-structured data. In particular, we consider recent works at Stanford U. and U. Penn on semi-structured data. In both cases, the motivation is found in the integration of heterogeneous data. The \"lightweight\" data models they use (based on labelled graphs) are very similar. As we shall see, the topic of semi-structur",

    "abstract": "The Accordiatron is a new MIDI controller for real-time performance based on the paradigm of a conventional squeeze box or concertina. It translates the gestures of a performer to the standard communication protocol ofMIDI, allowing for flexible mappings of performance data to sonic parameters. When used in conjunction with a realtime signal processing environment, the Accordiatron becomes an expressive, versatile musical instrument. A combination of sensory outputs providing both discrete and continuous data gives the subtle expressiveness and control necessary for interactive music.",

Various sensor technologies including image processing and general touch sensitive devices are employed to exploit these interaction media. The focus of our effort is to provide user-friendly and enjoyable experiences for new music and sound performances. Multimodality of musical instruments is explored in each attempt. The degree of controllability in the performance and the richness of expressions are also discussed for each installation.",

It gives users a 3dimensional tangible interface to control music using their hands, and can be used in conjunction with a traditional musical instrument and a microphone, or as a stand-alone gestural input device. The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time interface that can manipulate the parameters of a synthesis engine or effect algorithm in response to a performer’s expressive gestures. One example is to have the rods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of a granular synthesizer, thereby \"sonically sculpting\" the microstructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIX provides an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.",

We present custom controllers and unique adaptations of standard gestural interfaces, a programmable connectivity processor, a communications protocol called Open Sound Control(OSC), and a variety of metaphors for musical control. We further describe applications of our technology to a variety of real musical performances and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe three new music controllers, each designed to be played by two players. As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other’s actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people can be used as a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod’s position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players.",

MetaMuse is a prop-based system that uses the metaphor of rainfall to make the process of granular synthesis understandable. We discuss MetaMuse within a framework we call\"transparency\" that can be used as a predictor of the expressivity of musical devices. Metaphor depends on a literature,or cultural basis, which forms the basis for making transparent device mappings. In this context we evaluate the effect of metaphor in the MetaMuse system.",

The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player’s hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player’s hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control.",

The conceptual idea used is based on that of the traditional Bodhran instrument, an Irish frame drum. The design process was user-centered and involved professional Bodhran players and through prototyping and user testing the resulting Vodhran emerged.",

The key is driven by a direct drive motor, which allows friction free operations. The force to be generated by the motor is calculated in real time by a dynamic simulator, which contains the model of mechanisms’ components and constraints. Each model is tuned on the basis of measurements performed on the real system. So far, grand piano action, harpsichord and Hammond organ have been implemented successfully on the system presented here.",

This was initially explored in our Musical Trinkets installation, which used magnetically-coupled resonant LC circuits to identify and track the position of multiple objects in real-time. Manipulation of these objects in free space over a read coil triggered simple musical interactions. Musical Navigatrics builds upon this success with new more sensitive and stable sensing, multi-dimensional response, and vastly more intricate musical mappings that enable full musical exploration of free space through the dynamic use and control of arpeggiatiation and effects. The addition of basic sequencing abilities also allows for the building of complex, layered musical interactions in a uniquely easy and intuitive manner.",

The tymbalimba, a music controller based on this same mechanism, has a row of 4 convex aluminum ribs (ason the cicada’s tymbal) arranged much like the keys on a calimba. Each rib is spring loaded and capable of snapping down into a V-shape (a motion referred to as buckling), under the downward force of the user’s finger. This energy generated by the buckling motion is measured by an accelerometer located under each rib and used as the input to a physical model.",

    "abstract": "The Beatbugs are hand-held percussive instruments that allow the creation, manipulation, and sharing of rhythmic motifs through a simple interface. When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other’s motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized \"Nerve Center\" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system’s stochastic routing scheme and the players’ improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled \"Nerve\" was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover’s Toy Symphony \\[1\\] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano. The paper concludes with a short evaluative discussion of the concert and the weeklong workshops that led to it.",

It is not onlya metamorphosis of a traditional instrument, but a modern bridge of exploration into a rich musical heritage. It uses capacitive and piezo sensing technology to output MIDI and raw audio data.This new controller reads the key placement in two parallel planes by using radio capacitive sensing circuitry expanding greatly on the standard corrugated metal playing surface. The percussive output normally associated with the rubboard is captured through piezo contact sensors mounted directly on the keys (the playing implements). Additionally,mode functionality is controlled by discrete switching on the keys.This new instrument is meant to be easily played by both experienced players and those new to the rubboard. It lends itself to an expressive freedom by placing the control surface on the chest and allowing the hands to move uninhibited about it or by playing it in the usual way, preserving its musical heritage.",

Themain factor common to the design of most collaborativeinterfaces for novices is that musical control is highlyrestricted, which makes it possible to easily learn andparticipate in the collective experience. Balancing this tradeoff is a key concern for designers, as this happens at theexpense of providing an upward path to virtuosity with theinterface.

The purpose of this model is to construct acoherent and meaningful interaction between performer andinstrument. Such a model has been implicit in previous researchfor interactive performance systems. The model presented heredistinguishes gestural primitives from units of measure ofgestures. The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.",

Theconcept of this interface is based on the superposition of thegesture spatial place and the visual feedback spatial place; i tgives the impression that the graphical objects are real. Thisconcept enables a huge freedom in designing interfaces. Thegesture device we have created gives the position of fourfingertips using 3D sensors and the data is performed in theMax/MSP environment.

The authors discuss the challengesencountered while developing a responsive musicalenvironment for the general public involving wearable,sensor-integrated clothing as the central interface and input device. The project’s dramaturgical andtechnical/implementation background are detailed toprovide a framework for the creation of a responsive hardwareand software system that reinforces a tangible relationshipbetween the participant’s improvised movement and musicalresponse. Finally, the authors take into consideration testingscenarios gathered from public prototypes in two Europeanlocales in 2001 to evaluate user experience of the system.",

A doll serves the dual role of being bothan expressive agent and a playmate by allowing solo andaccompanied performance. An internal computer and sensorsystem allow the doll to receive input from the user and itssurroundings, and then respond accordingly with musicalfeedback. Sets of musical timbres and melodies may bechanged by presenting the doll with a series of themed clothhats, each suggesting a different style of play. The doll mayperform by itself and play a number of melodies, or it maycollaborate with the user when its limbs are squeezed or bent.Shared play is further encouraged by a basic set of aural tonesmimicking conversation.",

The Slidepipe is a performance controller that gives the artist a visually simple way to work with their material. Its design is modular and lightweight, so it can be easily transported and quickly assembled. Also, its large stature magnifies the gestures associated with its play, providing a more convincing performance. In this paper, I will describe what the controller is, how this new controller interface has affected my live performance, and how it can be used in different performance scenarios.",

So it is possible to use capturing interfaces with high-speed and high-resolution, thanks to the OSC protocol, for musical synthesis (either in realtime or non real-time). These new interfaces offer many advantages, not only in the area of musical composition with use of sensors but also in live and interactive performances. In this manner, the processes of calibration and signal processing are delocalized on a personal computer and augments possibilities of processing. In this demo, we present two hardware interfaces developed in La kitchen with corresponding processing to achieve a high-resolution, high-speed sensor processing for musical applications.",

In this paper, we will focus on neural network representation and implementation in a real-time musical environment. This adaptive mapping is evaluated in different static and dynamic situations by a network of sensors sampled at a rate of 200Hz in real-time. Finally, some remarks are given on the network design and future works.",

The device senses everyday interactions and surrounding contexts, and maps this information in real time to the sound processing of urban sounds. We conducted a short-term study with various participants using our prototype in everyday settings. This paper describes the course of the study and preliminary results in terms of how the participants used and experienced the system. These results showed that the city was perceived as the main performer but that the user improvised different tactics and ad hoc interventions to actively influence and participate in how the music was created.",

This approach is intended to provide new tools to facilitate bothcollaboration between visual artists and musicians and examination of perceptual issues between visual and acousticmedia. As a proof-of-concept, a complete example is developed with linear fractals as a basis for the animation, andarranged rhythmic loops for the music. Since both visualand acoustic elements in the example are generated fromconcise specifications, the potential of this approach to create new works through parameter space exploration is accentuated, however, there are opportunities for applicationto a wide variety of source material. These additional applications are also discussed, along with issues encounteredin development of the example.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an approach for playing expressivemusic, as it refers to a pianist’s expressiveness, with atapping-style interface. MIDI-formatted expressiveperformances played by pianists were first analyzed andtransformed into performance templates, in which thedeviations from a canonical description was separatelydescribed for each event. Using one of the templates as askill complement, a player can play music expressivelyover and under the beat level. This paper presents ascheduler that allows a player to mix her/his own intensionand the expressiveness in the performance template. Theresults of a forty-subject user study suggest that using theexpression template contributes the subject’s joy of playingmusic with the tapping-style performance interface. Thisresult is also supported by a brain activation study that wasdone using a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).Categories and Subject DescriptorsH.5.5 \\[Information Interfaces and Presentation\\]: Sound andMusic Computing methodologies and techniques.",

The Live Cinema instrument is a cross between a musical instrument and a film editing tool, tailored for improvisational control as well as performance presence. Design specifications for the instrument evolved based on several types of observations including: our own performances in which we used a prototype based on available tools; an analysis of performative aspects of contemporary DJ equipment; and an evaluation of organizational aspects of several generations of film editing tools. Our instrument presents the performer with a large canvas where projected images can be grabbed and moved around with both hands simultaneously; the performer also has access to two video drums featuring haptic display to manipulate the shots and cut between streams. The paper ends with a discussion of issues related to the tensions between narrative structure and hands-on control, live and recorded arts and the scoring of improvised films.",

We developed the first version of theThermoscore display by lining Peltier devices on piano keys.The system is controlled by MIDI notes-on messages from anMIDI sequencer, so that a composer can design songs that aresequences of temperature for each piano key. We also discussmethodologies for composing with this system, and suggesttwo approaches. The first is to make desirable keys (or otherkeys) hot. The second one uses chroma-profile, that is, a radarchart representation of the frequency of pitch notations in the-piece. By making keys of the same chroma hot in reverse proportion to the value of the chroma-profile, it is possible to-constrain the performer’s improvisation and to bring the tonality space close to a certain piece.",

The turntable functions as a standalone step sequencer for MIDI events transmitted to a computer or another device and it is programmed in real-time using visual disks. The program instructions are represented on printed paper disks directly as characters of English alphabet that could be read by human as effectively as they are picked up by the machine’s optical cartridge. The result is a tangible interface that allows the user to manipulate pre-arranged musical material by hand, by adding together instrumental tracks to form a dynamic mix. A functional implementation of this interface is discussed in view of historical background and other examples of electronic instruments for music creation and performance incorporating optical turntable as a central element.",

    "abstract": "On-the-fly programming is a style of programming in which the programmer/performer/composer augments and modifies the program while it is running, without stopping or restarting, in order to assert expressive, programmable control at runtime. Because of the fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. In this paper, we present a formalized framework for on-the-fly programming, based on the ChucK synthesis language, which supports a truly concurrent audio programming model with sample-synchronous timing, and a highly on-the-fly style of programming. We first provide a well-defined notion of on-thefly programming. We then address four fundamental issues that confront the on-the-fly programmer: timing, modularity, conciseness, and flexibility. Using the features and properties of ChucK, we show how it solves many of these issues. In this new model, we show that (1) concurrency provides natural modularity for on-the-fly programming, (2) the timing mechanism in ChucK guarantees on-the-fly precision and consistency, (3) the Chuck syntax improves conciseness, and (4) the overall system is a useful framework for exploring on-the-fly programming. Finally, we discuss the aesthetics of on-the-fly performance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years Computer Network-Music has increasingly captured the attention of the Computer Music Community. With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the , , authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time.",

The piece is comprised of seven autonomous water gong nodes that are networked together by water tubes to distribute water throughout the system. A water resource allocation algorithm guides this distribution process and produces an ever-evolving sonic and visual texture. A simple set of behaviors govern the individual gongs, and the system as a whole exhibits emergent properties that yield local and large scale forms in sound and light.",

Since the late 1990’s, the surging popularity of rhythmic and musical performance games in Japanese arcades has led to the development of new interfaces and alternate controllers for the consumer market worldwide. Rhythm action games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video game and toy markets in record numbers. Therefore, it is worth considering the potential benefits to developers of musical interfaces, electronic devices and alternate controllers in light of these new and emerging opportunities, particularly in the realm of video gaming, toy development, arcades, and other interactive entertainment experiences.",

    "abstract": "In the Expression Synthesis Project (ESP), we propose adriving interface for expression synthesis. ESP aims toprovide a compelling metaphor for expressive performance soas to make high-level expressive decisions accessible to nonexperts. In ESP, the user drives a car on a virtual road thatrepresents the music with its twists and turns; and makesdecisions on how to traverse each part of the road. The driver’sdecisions affect in real-time the rendering of the piece. Thepedals and wheel provide a tactile interface for controlling thecar dynamics and musical expression, while the displayportrays a first person view of the road and dashboard from thedriver’s seat. This game-like interface allows non-experts tocreate expressive renderings of existing music without havingto master an instrument, and allows expert musicians toexperiment with expressive choice without having to firstmaster the notes of the piece. The prototype system has beentested and refined in numerous demonstrations. This paperpresents the concepts underlying the ESP system and thearchitectural design and implementation of a prototype.",

With their ability to transform almost any physical objects, flat or curved surfaces and walls into interactive interfaces, acoustic sensing technologies show a promising way to bring the sense of touch into the realm of computer interaction. Because music making has been closely related to this sense during centuries, an application of particular interest is the use of TAI’s for the design of new musical instruments that matches the physicality and expressiveness of classical instruments. This paper gives an overview of the various acoustic-sensing technologies involved in the realisation of TAI’s and develops on the motivation underlying their use for the design of new musical instruments.",

On the other hand, human performers surpass McBlare in their ability to compensate for limitations and imperfections in reeds, and we discuss future enhancements to address these problems.

An increasing demand for this kind of hardware, especially in the field of dance and computer performance lead us to design a wireless digitizer that allows for multiple users, with high bandwidth and accuracy. The interface design was initiated in early 2004 and shortly described in reference \\[1\\]. Our recent effort was directed to make this device available for the community on the form of a manufactured product, similarly to our previous interfaces such as AtoMIC Pro, Eobody or Ethersense \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\]. We describe here the principles we used for the design of the device as well as its technical specifications. The demo will show several devices running at once and used in real-time with a various set of sensors.",

The Smart Controller is a stand alone device; a powerful, reliable, and compact instrument capable of reducing the number of electronic modules required in a live performance or installation, particularly the requirement of a laptop computer. More powerful, however, is the Smart Controller Workbench, a complete interactive development environment. In addition to enabling the composer to create and debug their patches, the Smart Controller Workbench accurately simulates the behaviour of the hardware, and functions as an incircuit debugger that enables the performer to remotely monitor, modify, and tune patches running in an installation without the requirement of stopping or interrupting the live performance.",

Performed on a hybrid projection system which combines a traditional analog overhead projector and a digital PC video projector, our vision-based software instruments generate dynamic sounds and graphics solely in response to the forms and movements of the silhouette contours of the user’s hands. Interactions and audiovisual mappings which make use of both positive (exterior) and negative (interior) contours are discussed.",

Our initial starting point was that computer music software and the way their interfaces are built need not necessarily be limited to copying the acoustic musical instruments and studio technology that we already have, but additionally we can create unique languages and work processes for the virtual world. The computer is a vast creative space with specific qualities that can and should be explored.",

    "abstract": "An experimental study comparing different user interfaces for a virtual drum is reported. Virtual here means that the drum is not a physical object. 16 subjects played the drum on five different interfaces and two metronome patterns trying to match their hits to the metronome clicks. Temporal accuracy of the playing was evaluated. The subjects also rated the interfaces subjectively. The results show that hitting the drum alternately from both sides with motion going through the drum plate was less accurate than the traditional one sided hitting. A physical stick was more accurate than a virtual computer graphic stick. Visual feedback of the drum slightly increased accuracy compared to receiving only auditory feedback. Most subjects evaluated the physical stick to offer a better feeling and to be more pleasant than the virtual stick.",

    "abstract": "Musicians and composers have been using brainwaves as generative sources in music for at least 40 years and the possibility of a brain-computer interface for direct communication and control was first seriously investigated in the early 1970s. Work has been done by many artists and technologists in the intervening years to attempt to control music systems with brainwaves and - indeed - many other biological signals. Despite the richness of EEG, fMRI and other data which can be read from the human brain, there has up to now been only limited success in translating the complex encephalographic data into satisfactory musical results. We are currently pursuing research which we believe will lead to the possibility of direct brain-computer interfaces for rich and expressive musical control. This report will outline the directions of our current research and results.",

    "abstract": "When learning a classical instrument, people often eithertake lessons in which an existing body of \"technique\" is delivered, evolved over generations of performers, or in somecases people will \"teach themselves\" by watching people playand listening to existing recordings. What does one do witha complex new digital instrument?In this paper I address this question drawing on my experience in learning several very different types of sophisticatedinstruments: the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speechinterface, the Digital Marionette controller for virtual 3Dpuppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary userof the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hourswith Digital Marionette and Glove-Talk II, and thousandsof hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue to work asa professional musician). I will identify some of the underlying principles and approaches that I have observed duringmy learning and playing experience common to these instruments. While typical accounts of users learning new interfaces generally focus on reporting beginner’s experiences, forvarious practical reasons, this is fundamentally different byfocusing on the expert’s learning experience.",

Our interface has allowed the development of a new vocabulary for musical and theatrical expression and the possibility for merging classical and experimental music. It gave rise to a strong, strange, unpredictable, yet coherent, \"character\" and opens up the possibility for a full performance that will explore aspects of voice, theatrical music and, in the future, image projection.",

    "abstract": "The breath pressure signal applied to wind music instruments is generally considered to be a slowly varying function of time. In a context of music control, this assumptionimplies that a relatively low digital sample rate (100-200Hz) is sufficient to capture and/or reproduce this signal.We tested this assumption by evaluating the frequency content in breath pressure, particularly during the use of extended performance techniques such as growling, humming,and flutter tonguing. Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes software tools used to create java applications for performing music using mobile phones. The tools provide a means for composers working in the Pure Data composition environment to design and audition performances using ensembles of mobile phones. These tools were developed as part of a larger project motivated by the desire to allow large groups of non-expert players to perform music based on just intonation using ubiquitous technology. The paper discusses the process that replicates a Pure Data patch so that it will operate within the hardware and software constraints of the Java 2 Micro Edition. It also describes development of objects that will enable mobile phone performances to be simulated accurately in PD and to audition microtonal tuning implemented using MIDI in the j2me environment. These tools eliminate the need for composers to compose for mobile phones by writing java code. In a single desktop application, they offer the composer the flexibility to write music for multiple phones.",

The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer’s finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.",

All too frequently,computer-based performers are tied to the keyboard-mousemonitor model, narrowly constraining the range of possiblegestures. A multitude of gestural input devices are readilyavailable, making it easy to utilize a broader range of gestures. Human Interface Devices (HIDs) such as joysticks,tablets, and gamepads are cheap and can be good musicalcontrollers. Some even provide haptic feedback. The \\[hid\\]toolkit provides a unified, consistent framework for gettinggestural data from these devices, controlling the feedback,and mapping this data to the desired output. The \\[hid\\]toolkit is built in Pd, which provides an ideal platform forthis work, combining the ability to synthesize and controlaudio and video.

It provides generalized audio abstractions and precise control over timing and concurrency - combining the rapid-prototyping advantages of high-level programming tools, such as Pure Data, with the flexibility and controllability of lower-level, text-based languages like C/C++. In this paper, we present a new time-based paradigm for programming controllers with ChucK. In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly.",

    "abstract": "The HandySinger system is a personified tool developedto naturally express a singing voice controlled by the gestures of a hand puppet. Assuming that a singing voice is akind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singingvoice are important for personification. We adopt a singingvoice morphing algorithm that effectively smoothes out thestrength of expressions delivered with a singing voice. Thesystem’s hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bendsensors and two pressure sensors. It sensitively capturesthe user’s motion as a personified puppet’s gesture. Tosynthesize the different expressional strengths of a singingvoice, the “normal” (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, “dark,” “whisper” and “wet,” are used asthe target. This configuration provides musically expressedcontrols that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, weevaluate whether 1) the morphing algorithm interpolatesexpressional strength in a perceptual sense, 2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and 3) the gestural mapping of the current systemworks as planned.",

Thisarticle begins with a brief overview of expression in musicalperformance, and examines some of the characteristics ofeffective \"expressive\" computer music instruments. Itbecomes apparent that sophisticated musical expressionrequires not only a good control interface but also virtuosicmastery of the instrument it controls. By studying effectiveacoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complexgesture-sound mappings that take advantage of establishedinstrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizationsof performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicatedpractice on a new interface, computer music instrumentdesigners can enhance the expressive quality of computermusic performance.",

TheeMouth is a driver that replaces the mouthpiece, with softwareemulation of trombone tone and algorithmic musical lines,allowing the trombone to appear to play itself. The eMute isbuilt around a loudspeaker unit, driven so that it affects stronglythe player’s embouchure, allowing fine control of complex beatpatterns. eMouth and eMute, under control of the uSlide, set upimprovisatory worlds that are part of the composed architectureof Rouse.",

Each song selected by the player makes the game look different and behave variedly. The concept is explored by modifying an existing video game and playtesting it with different kinds of MIDI music. Several examples of mapping MIDI parameters to game events are presented. As mobile phones’ MIDI players do not usually have a dedicated callback API, a real-time MIDI analysis software for Symbian OS was implemented. Future developments including real-time group performance as a way to control game content are also considered.",

In addition to musical parameters such as pitch and loudness, our system is able to analyze timbral characteristics of the saxophone tone in real-time, and use timbral information to guide the generation of response material. We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments in a free improvisation context.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our need for a Gesture Description Interchange Format (GDIF) for storing, retrieving and sharing information about music-related gestures. Ideally, it should be possible to store all sorts of data from various commercial and custom made controllers, motion capture and computer vision systems, as well as results from different types of gesture analysis, in a coherent and consistent way. This would make it possible to use the information with different software, platforms and devices, and also allow for sharing data between research institutions. We present some of the data types that should be included, and discuss issues which need to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "The gluion is a sensor interface that was designed to overcomesome of the limitations of more traditional designs based onmicrocontrollers, which only provide a small, fixed number ofdigital modules such as counters and serial interfaces. These areoften required to handle sensors where the physical parametercannot easily be converted into a voltage. Other sensors arepacked into modules that include converters and communicatevia SPI or I2C. Finallly, many designs require outputcapabilities beyond simple on/off.The gluion approaches these challenges thru its FPGA-baseddesign which allows for a large number of digital I/O modules.It also provides superior flexibility regarding theirconfiguration, resolution, and functionality. In addition, theFPGA enables a software implementation of the host link - inthe case of the gluion the OSC protocol as well as theunderlying Ethernet layers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe a new guitar-like musical controller. The ’GXtar’ is an instrument which takes as a starting point a guitar but his role is to bring different and new musical possibilities while preserving the spirit and techniques of guitar. Therefore, it was conceived and carried out starting from the body of an electric guitar. The fingerboard of this guitar was equipped with two lines of sensors: linear position sensors, and tactile pressure sensors. These two lines of sensors are used as two virtual strings. Their two ends are the bridge and the nut of the guitar. The design of the instrument is made in a way that the position of a finger, on one of these virtual strings, corresponds to the note, which would have been played on a real and vibrating string. On the soundboard of the guitar, a controller, with 3 degrees of freedom, allows to drive other synthesis parameters. We then describe how this interface is integrated in a musical audio system and serves as a musical instrument.",

At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto match a user’s gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo, gesture size, and the gesture’sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches, conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90",

The aim of this paper is not to describe these programs, as they have been described elsewhere \\[14\\]\\[15\\], but rather explicate the theoretical background that underlies the design of these screen-based instruments. After an analysis of the similarities and differences in the design of acoustic and screen-based instruments, the paper describes how the creation of an interface is essentially the creation of a semiotic system that affects and influences the musician and the composer. Finally the terminology of this semiotics is explained as an interaction model.",

While it is impossible to cover all such developments, we have tried to sample a variety of instruments from the last decade or so, with a greater focus on those published in the computer music literature. Experiences in the field of string players focusing on such developments are presented. Conclusions are drawn in which further research into violin-related digital instruments for string players may benefit from the presented criteria as well as the experiences.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes two new live performance scenarios for performing music using bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. Interaction between mobile phones via wireless link is a key feature of the performance interface for each scenario. Both scenarios are discussed in the context of two publicly performed works for an ensemble of players in which mobile phone handsets are used both as sound sources and as hand-held controllers. In both works mobile phones are mounted in a specially devised pouch attached to a cord and physically swung to produce audio chorusing. During performance some players swing phones while others operate phones as hand-held controllers. Wireless connectivity enables interaction between flying and hand-held phones. Each work features different bluetooth implementations. In one a dedicated mobile phone acts as a server that interconnects multiple clients, while in the other point to point communication takes place between clients on an ad hoc basis. The paper summarises bluetooth tools designed for live performance realisation and concludes with a comparative evaluation of both scenarios for future implementation of performance by large ensembles of nonexpert players performing microtonal music using ubiquitous technology.",

    "abstract": "A cost-effective method was developed for the estimation of the bow velocity in violin playing, using an accelerometer on the bow in combination with point tracking using a standard video camera. The video data are used to detect the moments of bow direction changes. This information is used for piece-wise integration of the accelerometer signal, resulting in a drift-free reconstructed velocity signal with a high temporal resolution. The method was evaluated using a 3D motion capturing system, providing a reliable reference of the actual bow velocity. The method showed good results when the accelerometer and video stream are synchronized. Additional latency and jitter of the camera stream can importantly decrease the performance of the method, depending on the bow stroke type.",

We first describe the project’s dramaturgical and conceptual context in order to situate theartistic framework that has guided the technological systemdesign. Specifically, this framework discusses the team’s approach in combining techniques from situated computing,theatrical sound design practice and dynamical systems inorder to create a new kind of adaptive audio scenographicenvironment augmented by wireless, distributed sensing foruse in live theatrical performance. The goal of this adaptive sound design is to move beyond both existing playbackmodels used in theatre sound as well as the purely humancentered, controller-instrument approach used in much current interactive performance practice.",

The Singer dynamic model for target tracking is used to describe the evolution of a Radiodrum’s stick position in time. The autocorrelation time constant of a gesture’s acceleration and the variance of the gesture acceleration are used to tune the model to various performance modes. Multiple Kalman Filters tuned to each gesture type are run in parallel and an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) is implemented to decide on the best combination of filter outputs to track the current gesture. Our goal is to accurately track Radiodrum gestures through noisy measurement signals.",

    "abstract": "FigureWe present Zstretch, a textile music controller that supports expressive haptic interactions. The musical controller takes advantage of the fabric’s topological constraints to enable proportional control of musical parameters. This novel interface explores ways in which one might treat music as a sheet of cloth. This paper proposes an approach to engage simple technologies for supporting ordinary hand interactions. We show that this combination of basic technology with general tactile movements can result in an expressive musical interface. a",

    "abstract": "A novel electronic percussion synthesizer prototype is presented. Our ambition is to design an instrument that will produce a high quality, realistic sound based on a physical modelling sound synthesis algorithm. This is achieved using a real-time Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the model coupled to an interface that aims to make efficient use of all the subtle nuanced gestures of the instrumentalist. It is based on a complex physical model of the vibrating plate - the source of sound in the majority of percussion instruments. A Xilinx Virtex II pro FPGA core handles the sound synthesis computations with an 8 billion operations per second performance and has been designed in such a way to allow a high level of control and flexibility. Strategies are also presented to that allow the parametric space of the model to be mapped to the playing gestures of the percussionist.",

Here, \"popular music\" is taken to mean music with a mostly steady tempo, some improvisational elements, and largely predetermined melodies, harmonies, and other parts. The overall problem is studied by developing a framework consisting of constraints and subproblems that any solution should address. These problems include beat acquisition, beat phase, score location, sound synthesis, data preparation, and adaptation. A prototype system is described that offers a set of solutions to the problems posed by the framework, and future work is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Chroma based representations of acoustic phenomenon are representations of sound as pitched acoustic energy. A framewise chroma distribution over an entire musical piece is a useful and straightforward representation of its musical pitch over time. This paper examines a method of condensing the block-wise chroma information of a musical piece into a two dimensional embedding. Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion.",

We define a Sonic Localization Field using sound attenuation and ITD azimuth angle parameters and, in order to control an adaptive algorithm, we used pairs of these parameters as Spatial Sound Genotypes (SSG). They are extracted from waveforms which are considered individuals of a Population Set. A user-interface receives input from a generic gesture interface (such as a NIME device) and interprets them as ITD cues. Trajectories provided by these signals are used as Target Sets of an evolutionary algorithm. A Fitness procedure optimizes locally the distance between the Target Set and the SSG pairs. Through a parametric score the user controls dynamic changes in the sound output.",

Mimi is a performer-centric tool designed for use in performance and teaching. Its key andnovel component is its visual interface, designed to providethe performer with instantaneous and continuous information on the state of the system. For human improvisation,in which context and planning are paramount, the relevantstate of the system extends to the near future and recentpast. Mimi’s visual interface allows for a peculiar blendof raw reflex typically associated with improvisation, andpreparation and timing more closely affiliated with scorebased reading. Mimi is not only an effective improvisationpartner, it has also proven itself to be an invaluable platformthrough which to interrogate the mental models necessaryfor successful improvisation.",

Too often soundscapes and background music are predetermined, repetitive and somewhat predictable. Yet, there is room for more complex and interesting sonification schemes that can improve the sensation of presence in a Virtual Environment. In this paper we propose a system that automatically generates original background music in real-time called VR-RoBoser. As a test case we present the application of VR-RoBoser to a dynamic avatar that explores its environment. We show that the musical events are directly and continuously generated and influenced by the behavior of the avatar in three-dimensional virtual space, generating a context dependent sonification.",

    "abstract": "Almost all traditional musical instruments have a one-to-one correspondence between a given fingering and the pitch that sounds for that fingering. The Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee does not - it is a keyboard MIDI controller that is based on intervals rather than fixed pitches. That is, a given keypress will sound a pitch a number of steps away from the last note sounded (within the key signature and scale selected) according to the ’delta’ value assigned to that key. The advantages of such a system are convenience, speed, and the ability to play difficult, unusual and/or unintended passages extemporaneously.",

    "abstract": "We describe the prevailing model of musical expression, which assumes a binary formulation of \"the text\" and \"the act,\" along with its implied roles of composer and performer. We argue that this model not only excludes some contemporary aesthetic values but also limits the communicative ability of new music interfaces. As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies.",

    "abstract": "A crucial set of decisions in digital musical instrument design deals with choosing mappings between parameters controlled by the performer and the synthesis algorithms that actually generate sound. Feature-based synthesis offers a way to parameterize audio synthesis in terms of the quantifiable perceptual characteristics, or features, the performer wishes the sound to take on. Techniques for accomplishing such mappings and enabling feature-based synthesis to be performed in real time are discussed. An example is given of how a real-time performance system might be designed to take advantage of feature-based synthesis’s ability to provide perceptually meaningful control over a large number of synthesis parameters.",

The design of the initial prototype and environment-specific issues are described, as well as prior work in the field.

This paper overviews our recent work with the system’s interaction management component (IMC). We explore several options for characterizing improvisation at a higher level, and managing decisions for interactive performance in a rich timbral environment. We developed a simple, efficient framework using a small number of features suggested by recent work in mood modeling in music. We describe and evaluate the first version of the IMC, which was used in performance at the Live Algorithms for Music (LAM) conference in December 2006. We touch on developments on the system since LAM, and discuss future plans to address perceived shortcomings in responsiveness, and the ability of the system to make long-term adaptations.",

    "abstract": "The FrankenPipe project is an attempt to convert a traditionalHighland Bagpipe into a controller capable of driving both realtime synthesis on a laptop as well as a radio-controlled (RC) car.Doing so engages musical creativity while enabling novel, oftenhumorous, performance art. The chanter is outfitted withphotoresistors (CdS photoconductive cells) underneath each hole,allowing a full range of MIDI values to be produced with eachfinger and giving the player a natural feel. An air-pressure sensoris also deployed in the bag to provide another element of controlwhile capturing a fundamental element of bagpipe performance.The final product navigates the realm of both musical instrumentand toy, allowing the performer to create a novel yet richperformance experience for the audience.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present the concept and prototype of a new musical interface that utilizes the close relationship between gestural expression in the act of painting and that of playing a musical instrument in order to provide non-musicians the opportunity to create musical expression. A physical brush on a canvas acts as the instrument. The characteristics of its stroke are intuitively mapped to a conductor program, defining expressive parameters of the tone in real-time. Two different interaction modes highlight the importance of bodily expression in making music as well as the value of a metaphorical visual representation.",

Using a combination of both spectral (Fourier) andspatial analysis of onsets, we are able to extract repeating rhythmic patterns from data collected using accelerometers. These extracted rhythmic patterns show the relative magnitudes of accentuated movements and their spacing in time. Inspired by previouswork in automatic beat detection of audio recordings, we designedour algorithms to be robust to changes in timing using multipleanalysis techniques and methods for sensor fusion, filtering andclustering. We tested our system using a limited set of movements,as well as dance movements collected from a professional, bothwith promising results.",

REXband builds upon previous work in interactivemusic exhibits by incorporating aspects of e-learning to educate, inaddition to interaction design patterns to entertain; care was alsotaken to ensure historic authenticity. Feedback from user testingin both controlled (laboratory) and public (museum) environmentshas been extremely positive.

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a survey conducted in the autumn of 2006 with the objective to understand people’s relationship to their musical tools. The survey focused on the question of embodiment and its different modalities in the fields of acoustic and digital instruments. The questions of control, instrumental entropy, limitations and creativity were addressed in relation to people’s activities of playing, creating or modifying their instruments. The approach used in the survey was phenomenological, i.e. we were concerned with the experience of playing, composing for and designing digital or acoustic instruments. At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc.",

We focus more on the aesthetic, conceptual, and practical aspects of the interface and less on the technological details. We especially stress the influence that the designed interface poses on the compositional process and how we approach the expressive organisation of musical materials during the composition of the piece, as well as the addition of nuances (personal real-time expression) by the musicians at performance time.",

However, the majority of these new applications are either not well known, used orconsidered in a broader context by their target users. The necessaryexchange between the world of developers and the players is ratherlimited. A group of performers, researchers, instrument developersand composers was founded in order to share expertise and experiences and to give each other feedback on the work done to developnew instruments. Instruments incorporating new interfaces, synthesis methods, sensor technology, new materials like carbon fiber andwood composites as well as composite materials and research outcome are presented and discussed in the group.

The gestural controller is based on the theremin concept in which only an antenna is used as a proximity sensor. This interactive process is guided by sensorial consonance curves and adaptive tuning related to psychoacoustical studies. We used an algorithm to calculate the dissonance values according to amplitudes and frequencies of a given sound spectrum. The theoretical background is presented followed by interactive composition strategies and sound results.",

    "abstract": "Playing music over the Internet, whether for real-time jamming, network performance or distance education, is constrained by the speed of light which introduces, over long distances, time delays unsuitable for musical applications. Current musical collaboration systems generally transmit compressed audio streams over low-latency and high-bandwidthnetworks to optimize musician synchronization. This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum, the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs. Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.",

The techniques for rendering acoustic events on multi-speaker or headphone-based surround systems have evolved considerably, making it possible to use them in real-time performances on light equipment. Controlling the placement of sound sources is usually done in idiosyncratic ways and has not yet been fully explored and formalized. This issue is addressed here with the proposition of a methodical approach. The mapping of gestures to source motion is implemented by giving the sources physical object properties and manipulating these characteristics with standard geometrical transforms through hierarchical or emergent relationships.",

It is essentially a Linux based SBC(Single Board Computer) with 802.11a/b/g wireless capability.The device, with batteries, only weighs a few pounds and can beworn by a dancer or other live performer. Past work has focusedon connecting \"conventional\" sensors (eg., bend sensors,accelerometers, FSRs, etc...) to the board and using it as a datarelay, sending the data as real time control messages to synthesisengines like Max/MSP and RTcmix1. Current research hasextended the abilities of the device to take real-time audio andvideo data from USB cameras and audio devices, as well asrunning synthesis engines on board the device itself. Given itsgeneric network ability (eg., being an 802.11a/b/g device) there istheoretically no limit to the number of WISEAR boxes that canbe used simultaneously in a performance, facilitating multiperformer compositions. This paper will present the basic design philosophy behindWISEAR, explain some of the basic concepts and methods, aswell as provide a live demonstration of the running device, wornby the , , author.",

The focus is on sound processing techniques which contain a high number of control parameters,and which exhibit subtle and interesting micro-variationsand textural qualities when controlled properly. The examples all use a simple low-dimensional controller - a standardgraphics tablet - and the task of initimate and subtle textural manipulations is left to the design of proper mappings,created using a custom toolbox of mapping functions. Thiswork further acts to contextualize past theoretical results bythe given musical presentations, and arrives at some conclusions about the interplay between musical intention, controlstrategies and the process of their design.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a new interface prototype for live music mixing. The ColorDex system employs a completely new operational metaphor which allows the mix DJ to prepare up to six tracks at once, and perform mixes between up to three of those at a time. The basic premises of the design are: 1) Build a performance tool that multiplies the possible choices a DJ has in respect in how and when tracks are prepared and mixed; 2) Design the system in such a way that the tool does not overload the performer with unnecessary complexity, and 3) Make use of novel technology to make the performance of live music mixing more engaging for both the performer and the audience. The core components of the system are: A software program to load, visualize and playback digitally encoded tracks; the HDDJ device (built chiefly out of a repurposed hard disk drive), which provides tactile manipulation of the playback speed and position of tracks; and the Cubic Crossfader, a wireless sensor cube that controls of the volume of individual tracks, and allows the DJ to mix these in interesting ways.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the latest developments of the Public Sound Objects (PSOs) system, an experimental framework to implement and test new concepts for Networked Music. The project of a Public interactive installation using the PSOs system was commissioned in 2007 by Casa da Musica, the main concert hall space in Porto. It resulted in a distributed musical structure with up to ten interactive performance terminals distributed along the Casa da Musica’s hallways, collectively controlling a shared acoustic piano. The installation allows the visitors to collaborate remotely with each other, within the building, using a software interface custom developed to facilitate collaborative music practices and with no requirements in terms previous knowledge of musical performance.",

    "abstract": "We combine two concepts, the musical instrument as metaphorand technology probes, to explore how tangible interfaces canexploit the semantic richness of sound. Using participatorydesign methods from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), wedesigned and tested the A20, a polyhedron-shaped, multichannel audio input/output device. The software maps soundaround the edges and responds to the user’s gestural input,allowing both aural and haptic modes of interaction as well asdirect manipulation of media content. The software is designedto be very flexible and can be adapted to a wide range ofshapes. Our tests of the A20’s perceptual and interactionproperties showed that users can successfully detect soundplacement, movement and haptic effects on this device. Ourparticipatory design workshops explored the possibilities of theA20 as a generative tool for the design of an extended,collaborative personal music player. The A20 helped users toenact scenarios of everyday mobile music player use and togenerate new design ideas.",

Next, we review guitarlike interfaces, and we design an interface to a virtual string.The excitation signal and pitch are sensed separately usingtwo independent string segments. These parameters controla two-axis digital waveguide virtual string, which modelsvibrations in the horizontal and vertical transverse axes aswell as the coupling between them. Finally, we consider theadvantages of using a multi-axis pickup for measuring theexcitation signal.",

Agent-based software offers a new method for real-time composition that allows for complex interactions between individual voices while requiring very little user interaction or supervision. The system described, Kinetic Engine, is an environment in which individual software agents, emulate drummers improvising within a percussion ensemble. Player agents assume roles and personalities within the ensemble, and communicate with one another to create complex rhythmic interactions. In this project, the ensemble is comprised of a 12-armed musical robot, MahaDeviBot, in which each limb has its own software agent controlling what it performs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a pitch space based musical interface approach. A pitch space arranges tones in a way that meaningful tone combinations can be easily generated. Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists \\[11\\], \\[2\\]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music.",

This work takes inspiration from Bauhaus’ ideals and Paul Klee’s investigation into forms and pictorial representation.

By means of a demonstrative tool, we introduce here a line of research that is at its initial stage. The envisaged goal of future developments is a novel system that could be a composing/improvising tool as well as an interface for interactive dance and performance.",

By interacting withobjects representing scratch patterns commonly performedon the turntable and the crossfader, the musician can playwith DJ techniques and manipulate how they are executedin a performance. This is a novel approach to the digital DJapplications and hardware. Two expert musicians practisedand performed on the reactable in order to both evaluate theplayability and improve the design of the DJ techniques.",

    "abstract": "One of the advantages of case-based systems is that theycan generate expressions even if the user doesn’t know howthe system applies expression rules. However, the systemscannot avoid the problem of data sparseness and do notpermit a user to improve the expression of a certain part ofa melody directly. After discussing the functions requiredfor user-oriented interface for performance rendering systems, this paper proposes a directable case-based performance rendering system, called Itopul. Itopul is characterized by 1) a combination of the phrasing model and thepulse model, 2) the use of a hierarchical music structure foravoiding from the data sparseness problem, 3) visualizationof the processing progress, and 4) music structures directlymodifiable by the user.",

We have beendeveloping an audio-visual manipulation system that realizes tracks control, time-based operations and searching fortracks from massive music library. It aims to build an emotional and affecting musical interaction, and will providea better method of music listening to people. A sophisticated glove-like device with an acceleration sensor and several strain sensors has been developed. A realtime signalprocessing and musical control are executed as a result ofgesture recognition. We also developed a stand-alone device that performs as a musical controller and player at thesame time. In this paper, we describe the development of acompact and sophisticated sensor device, and demonstrateits performance of audio and video signals control.",

The termAmbient Musical Information Systems (AMIS) is proposedto describe this kind of research. Instruments like these differ from standard musical instruments in that they are tobe perceived indirectly from outside one’s primary focus ofattention. We describe our rationale for creating such a device, a discussion on the appropriate qualities of sound fordelivering ambient information, and a description of an instrument created for use in a series of experiments that wewill use to test out ideas. We conclude with a discussion ofour initial findings, and some further directions we wish toexplore.",

    "abstract": "It started with an idea to create an empty space in which you activated music and light as you moved around. In responding to the music and lighting you would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children’s spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children’s movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation.",

The study offered some valuable results,but our picture of the Wiimote was incomplete as we lackeddata concerning the participants’ instantaneous musical experience.

    "abstract": "Sound libraries for music synthesizers easily comprise onethousand or more programs (\"patches\"). Thus, there areenough raw data to apply data mining to reveal typicalsettings and to extract dependencies. Intelligent user interfaces for music synthesizers can be based on such statistics.This paper proposes two approaches: First, the user setsany number of parameters and then lets the system find thenearest sounds in the database, a kind of patch autocompletion. Second, all parameters are \"live\" as usual, but turningone knob or setting a switch will also change the settingsof other, statistically related controls. Both approaches canbe used with the standard interface of the synthesizer. Ontop of that, this paper introduces alternative or additionalinterfaces based on data visualization.",

In this paper, we describe a computer-based notation and gestural control system for independently manipulating the tempi of musical parts within a piece, at performance time. We describe how the problem was approached, drawing upon feedback and suggestions from consultations across multiple disciplines, seeking analogous problems in other fields. Throughout, our approach is guided and, ultimately, assessed by an established professional composer, who was able to interact with a working prototype of the system.",

Real-time images of stageperformers, pre-recorded and live video, as well as more exoticdata from imaging systems such as thermography, pressuresensor arrays, etc. can be used as a source of control. Featurepoints are extracted from the candidate images, from whichmotion vector fields are calculated. After some processing, thesemotion vectors are mapped individually to sound synthesisparameters. Suitable synthesis techniques include granular andmicrosonic algorithms, additive synthesis and micro-polyphonicorchestration. Implementation details of this framework isdiscussed, as well as suitable creative and artistic uses andapproaches.",

    "abstract": "Moving out of doors with digital tools and electronic music and creating musically rich experiences is made possible by the increased availability of ever smaller and more powerful mobile computers. Composing music for and in a landscape instead of for a closed architectural space offers new perspectives but also raises questions about interaction and composition of electronic music. The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user’s willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored.",

To solve this problem, the goal ofour study is to construct UnitKeyboard, which has only 12keys (7 white keys and 5 black keys) and connectors fordocking with other UnitKeyboards. We can build variouskinds of musical keyboard configurations by connecting oneUnitKeyboard to others, since they have automatic settingsfor multiple keyboard instruments.

In the general case ofhuman-computer interfaces, users are often confined to afixed location, severely limiting mobility. To overcome thisconstraint in the context of musical interaction, we presenta system to manage large-scale collaborative mobile audioenvironments, driven by user movement. Multiple participants navigate through physical space while sharing overlaid virtual elements. Each user is equipped with a mobilecomputing device, GPS receiver, orientation sensor, microphone, headphones, or various combinations of these technologies. We investigate methods of location tracking, wireless audio streaming, and state management between mobiledevices and centralized servers. The result is a system thatallows mobile users, with subjective 3-D audio rendering,to share virtual scenes. The audio elements of these scenescan be organized into large-scale spatial audio interfaces,thus allowing for immersive mobile performance, locativeaudio installations, and many new forms of collaborativesonic activity.",

These involve the connection of three development environments: Python, SuperCollider and Processing, in order to drive kinetic art installations and to combine these with digital synthesis of sound and image in real time. By connecting these three platforms via the OSC protocol, we enable the control in real time of analog physical media (a device that draws figures on sand), sound synthesis and image synthesis. We worked on the development of algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media.",

Thirdly, the practical ways in which a composer can use Versum to make his own audiovisual compositions are presented by means of a more detailed description of the different graphical user interface elements. Fourthly, a short description is given of the modular structure of the software underlying Versum. Finally, several foresights regarding the directions in which Versum will continue to develop in the near future are presented.",

By programming feedback controllers to emulate the laws of physics, many haptic musical instruments have been previously designed thatmimic real acoustic musical instruments.

We presenta novel method for constructing haptic musical instrumentsin which a haptic device is directly interfaced with a conventional digital waveguide model by way of a junction element, improving the quality of the musician’s interactionwith the virtual instrument.

The finite reaction time of thehuman motor control system implies that the execution of abrief musical gesture does not rely on immediate feedbackfrom the senses, rather it is preprogrammed to some degree.Consequently, we suggest designing relatively simple anddeterministic interfaces for providing haptic assistance.In this paper, we consider the specific problem of assisting a musician in selecting pitches from a continuous range.We build on a prior study by O’Modhrain of the accuracyof pitches selected by musicians on a Theremin-like hapticinterface. To improve the assistance, we augment the interface with programmed detents so that the musician can feelthe locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, themusician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such asglissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various formsof haptic detents, including fixed detent levels and forcesensitive detent levels. Preliminary results from a subjecttest confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection broughtabout by detents.",

Nevertheless, such interfaces are generally physically situated and can limit the possibility of movements on the stage, a critical factor in live music performance. In this paper we introduce the Drummer, a networked digital musical interface that allows multiple performers to design and play drum kits simultaneously while, at the same time, keeping their ability to freely move on the stage. The system consists of multiple Nintendo DS clients with an intuitive, user-configurable interface and a server computer which plays drum sounds. The Drummer Machine, a small piece of hardware to augment the performance of the Drummer, is also introduced.",

The primary goal of this study was to determine how players’ actions changed when moving from an acoustic instrument like the tom drum, to a gestural controller like the Buchla Lightning, which bears little resemblance to an acoustic percussion instrument. Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject’s hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects’ timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented.",

MagNular is a sound toy utilizingcomputer game and physics engine technologies to createan animated interface used in conjunction with an externalsound engine developed within Max/MSP. The playercontrols virtual magnets that attract or repel numerousparticle objects, moving them freely around the virtualspace. Particle object collision data is mapped to controlsound onsets and synthesis/DSP (Digital SignalProcessing) parameters. The user \"composes\" bycontrolling and influencing the simulated physicalbehaviors of the particle objects within the animatedinterface.",

We propose a method for harnessing machine learning algorithms within a radically interactive paradigm, in which the designer may repeatedly generate examples, train a learner, evaluate outcomes, and modify parameters in real-time within a single software environment. We describe our meta-instrument, the Wekinator, which allows a user to engage in on-the-fly learning using arbitrary control modalities and sound synthesis environments. We provide details regarding the system implementation and discuss our experiences using the Wekinator for experimentation and performance.",

The system which we propose contains both a gesture controller and robots at the same time. In this system, the Data Suit, BodySuit controls the avatar in Second Life and Second Life controls the exoskeleton, Powered Suit in real time. These are related with each other in conjunction with Second Life in Internet. BodySuit doesn’t contain a hand-held controller. A performer, for example a dancer, wears a suit. Gestures are transformed into electronic signals by sensors. Powered Suit is another suit that a dancer wears, but gestures are generated by motors. This is a sort of wearable robot. Second Life is software that is developed by Linden Lab. It allows creating a virtual world and a virtual human (avatar) in Internet. Working together with BodySuit, Powered Suit, and Second Life the idea behind the system is that a human body is augmented by electronic signals and is reflected in a virtual world in order to be able to perform interactively.",

We distinguishbetween style and structure of an interaction and discuss thesignificance of this formulation within the context of NIME.Two workshops that were conducted to explore style in interaction design are described, from which we identify elements of style that can inform and influence the design process. From these, we suggest steps toward designing forstyle in new musical interactions.",

Thenoise is composed of uncontrolled movement generated bythe interaction of the arm with the piano action and measurement error. We propose a probabilistic model for armtouch movements, which allows to estimate the amount ofnoise in a joint. This estimation helps to interpret the movement signal, which is of interest for augmented piano andpiano pedagogy applications.",

    "abstract": "The carillon is one of the few instruments that elicit sophisticated haptic interaction from amateur and professional players alike. Like the piano keyboard, the velocity of a player’s impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon in Canberra.",

The increase in usage of portable music players during exercisehas given rise to the development of new personal exerciseaids, most notably the Nike+iPod system, which relies onembedded sensor technologies to provide kinematic workout statistics. There are also systems that select songs basedon the measured step frequency of a runner. The proposedsystem also uses the pace of a runner, but this information isused to change the tempo of the music.",

The natural running behavior of four subjects is measured with a wearable sensor prototype and analyzed to create normalized tempo curves. The resulting curves are then used to modulate the final ritard of MIDI scores, which are also performed by an expert musician. A Turing-inspired listening test is conducted to observe a human listener’s ability to determine the nature of the performer.",

The pianist generates graphic elements while playing music and the graphic performer generates piano notes by drawing lines. The paper focuses on interfacing sounds and images performed by the pianist. It provides rationale for the choice of materials of great simplicity and describes our approach to mapping.",

    "abstract": "Deviate generates multiple streams of melodic and rhythmic output in real-time, according to user-specified control parameters. This performance system has been implemented using Max 5 \\[1\\] within the genre of popular contemporary electronic music, incorporating techno, IDM, and related forms. The aim of this project is not musical style synthesis, but to construct an environment in which a range of creative and musical goals may be achieved. A key aspect is control over generative processes, as well as consistent yet varied output. An approach is described which frees the user from determining note-level output while allowing control to be maintained over larger structural details, focusing specifically on the melodic aspect of this system. Audio examples are located online at http://www.cetenbaath.com/cb/about-deviate/.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe an approach for introducing newelectronic percussive sound possibilities for stringinstruments by \"listening\" to the sounds of the instrument’sbody and extracting audio and data from the wood’sacoustic vibrations. A method for capturing, localizing andanalyzing the percussive hits on the instrument’s body ispresented, in connection with an audio-driven electronicpercussive sound module. The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on the instrument’s body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely used in the acoustic instrumentalpraxis. They yield a strong potential for providing anextended soundscape via instrument augmentation, directlycontrolled by the musician through haptic manipulation ofthe instrument itself. The research work was carried out onthe electric guitar, but the method used can apply to anystring instrument with a resonating body.",

It is a new hybrid instrument that facilitates simultaneous acoustic and electronic playing. The normal playing skills of a trumpet player apply to the new instrument. The placing of the buttons and sensors is not a hindrance to acoustic use of the instrument and they are conveniently located. The device can be easily attached to and detached from a normal Bb-trumpet. The device has a wireless connection with the computer through Bluetooth-serial (Arduino). Audio and data processing in the computer is effected by three separate instances of MAX/MSP connected through OSC (controller data) and Soundflower (sound data). The current prototype consists of 7 analogue sensors (4 valve-like potentiometers, 2 pressure sensors, 1 \"Ribbon\" controller) and 9 digital switches. An LCD screen that is controlled by a separate Arduino (mini) is attached to the trumpet and displays the current controller settings that are sent through a serial connection.",

    "abstract": "This is a technical and experimental report of parallel processing, using the \"Propeller\" chip. Its eight 32 bits processors (cogs) can operate simultaneously, either independently or cooperatively, sharing common resources through a central hub. I introduce this unique processor and discuss about the possibility to develop interactive systems and smart interfaces in media arts, because we need many kinds of tasks at a same time with NIMErelated systems and installations. I will report about (1) Propeller chip and its powerful IDE, (2) external interfaces for analog/digital inputs/outputs, (3) VGA/NTSC/PAL video generation, (4) audio signal processing, and (5) originally-developed MIDI input/output method. I also introduce three experimental prototype systems.",

The system utilizes the Wii Remote, which users hold and move like a conducting baton to affect the tempo and dynamics of an orchestral video/audio recording. The accelerometer data from the Wii Remote is used to control playback speed and volume in real-time. The system is housed in a UBSbranded kiosk that has toured classical performing arts venues throughout the United States and Europe in 2007 and 2008. In this paper we share our experiences in designing this standalone system for thousands of users, and lessons that we learned from the project.",

    "abstract": "We developed a system called Life Game Orchestra that generates music by translating cellular patterns of Conway’s Game of Life into musical scales. A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping, clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra is a fusion system of the design of a performer and the emergence of cellular automata as a complex system.",

    "abstract": "\"Music for 32 Chess Pieces\" is a software system that supports composing, performing and improvising music by playing a chess game. A game server stores a representation of the state of a game, validates proposed moves by players, updates game state, and extracts a graph of piece-to-piece relationships. It also loads a plugin code module that acts as a composition. A plugin maps pieces and relationships on the board, such as support or attack relationships, to a timed sequence of notes and accents. The server transmits notes in a sequence to an audio renderer process via network datagrams. Two players can perform a composition by playing chess, and a player can improvise by adjusting a plugin’s music mapping parameters via a graphical user interface. A composer can create a new composition by writing a new plugin that uses a distinct algorithm for mapping game rules and states to music. A composer can also write a new note-to-sound mapping program in the audio renderer language. This software is available at http://faculty.kutztown.edu/parson/music/ParsonMusic.html.",

    "abstract": "Haptic feedback is an important element that needs to be carefully designed in computer music interfaces. This paper presents an evaluation of several force renderings for target acquisition in space when used to support a music related task. The study presented here addresses only one musical aspect: the need to repeat elements accurately in time and in content. Several force scenarios will be rendered over a simple 3D target acquisition task and users’ performance will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The results show how the users’ subjective preference for a particular kind of force support does not always correlate to a quantitative measurement of performance enhancement. We describe a way in which a control mapping for a musical interface could be achieved without contradicting the users’ preferences as obtained from the study.",

In thispaper, we present a system which makes use of the infraredcamera within the Wii remote to capture the gestures of aconductor using a baton with an infrared LED and battery.Our system then performs data analysis with gesture classification and following, and finally displays the gestures using visual baton trajectories and audio feedback. Gesturetrajectories are displayed in real time and can be comparedto the corresponding diagram shown in a textbook. In addition, since a conductor normally does not look at a screenwhile conducting, tones are played to represent a certainbeat in a conducting gesture. Further, the system can be controlled entirely with the baton, removing the need to switchfrom baton to mouse. The interface is intended to be usedfor pedagogy purposes.",

    "abstract": "Music composition on computer is a challenging task, involving a range of data types to be managed within a single software tool. A composition typically comprises a complex arrangement of material, with many internal relationships between data in different locations repetition, inversion, retrograde, reversal and more sophisticated transformations. The creation of such complex artefacts is labour intensive, and current systems typically place a significant cognitive burden on the composer in terms of maintaining a work as a coherent whole. FrameWorks 3D is an attempt to improve support for composition tasks within a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) style environment via a novel three-dimensional (3D) user-interface. In addition to the standard paradigm of tracks, regions and tape recording analogy, FrameWorks displays hierarchical and transformational information in a single, fully navigable workspace. The implementation combines Java with Max/MSP to create a cross-platform, user-extensible package and will be used to assess the viability of such a tool and to develop the ideas further.",

A layered method is developed whichpermits the conversion of serial data such as MIDI to OSCformatted network packets with an overall system latencybelow 5 milliseconds for common MIDI messages.The Gumstix embedded computer provide an interesting and modular platform for the development of such anembedded applications. The project shows great potentialto evolve into a generic sensors-to-OSC ethernet converterwhich should be very useful for artistic purposes and couldbe used as a fast prototyping interface for gesture acquisitiondevices.",

The Kalichord uses the analog signal from plucked acoustic tines to excite a physical string model, allowing a nuanced and intuitive plucking experience. First, we catalog instruments related to the Kalichord. Then we examine the use of analog signals to excite a physical string model and discuss the expressiveness and form factors that this technique affords. We then describe the overall construction of the Kalichord and possible playing styles, and finally we consider ways we hope to improve upon the current prototype.",

The system is currently implementedand assessed as a potential means to reduce motion-induceddistortion in CT images.A museum installation based on the same principle wascreated in which an inexpensive wall-mounted web camera tracks an IR sensor embedded into a pendant worn bythe user. The motion of the subjects breathing is trackedand interpreted as a real-time variable tempo adjustment toa stored musical file. The subject can then adjust his/herbreathing to synchronize with a separate accompanimentline. When the breathing is regular and is at the desiredtempo, the audible result sounds synchronous and harmonious. The accompaniment’s tempo progresses and gradually decrease which causes the breathing to synchronize andslow down, thus increasing relaxation.",

    "abstract": "During several decades, the research at Waseda University has been focused on developing anthropomorphic robots capable performing musical instruments. As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an interactive and improvisational jam session, including human players and two robotic musicians. The project was developed in an effort to create novel and inspiring music through human-robot collaboration. The jam session incorporates Shimon, a newly-developed socially-interactive robotic marimba player, and Haile, a perceptual robotic percussionist developed in previous work. The paper gives an overview of the musical perception modules, adaptive improvisation modes and human-robot musical interaction models that were developed for the session. The paper also addresses the musical output that can be created from increased interconnections in an expanded multiple-robot multiplehuman ensemble, and suggests directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether a dynamic vibrotactile feedback improves the playability of a gesture controlled virtual instrument. The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument.",

    "abstract": "\"VirtualPhilharmony\" (V.P.) is a conducting interface that enables users to perform expressive music with conducting action. Several previously developed conducting interfaces do not satisfy users who have conducting experience because the feedback from the conducting action does not always correspond with a natural performance. The tempo scheduler, which is the main engine of a conducting system, must be improved. V.P. solves this problem by introducing heuristics of conducting an orchestra in detecting beats, applying rules regarding the tempo expression in a bar, etc. We confirmed with users that the system realized a high \"following\" performance and had musical persuasiveness.",

This technique consists in creating musical trees whosenodes are composed of sound effects applied to a musical content.In the leaves, this content is a one-shot sound, whereas in higherlevel nodes this content is composed of live-recorded sequencesof parameters of the children nodes. Drile allows musicians tointeract efficiently with these trees in an immersive environment.Nodes are represented as worms, which are 3D audiovisual objects. Worms can be manipulated using 3D interaction techniques,and several operations can be applied to the live-looping trees. Theenvironment is composed of several virtual rooms, i.e. group oftrees, corresponding to specific sounds and effects. Learning Drileis progressive since the musical control complexity varies according to the levels in live-looping trees. Thus beginners may havelimited control over only root worms while still obtaining musically interesting results. Advanced users may modify the trees andmanipulate each of the worms.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a virtual violin for real-time performances consisting of two modules: a violin spectral modeland a control interface. The interface is composed by asensing bow and a tube with drawn strings in substitutionof a real violin. The spectral model is driven by the bowingcontrols captured with the control interface and it is ableto predict spectral envelopes of the sound corresponding tothose controls. The envelopes are filled with harmonic andnoisy content and given to an additive synthesizer in orderto produce violin sounds. The sensing system is based ontwo motion trackers with 6 degrees of freedom. One trackeris attached to the bow and the other to the tube. Bowingcontrols are computed after a calibration process where theposition of virtual strings and the hair-ribbon of the bowis obtained. A real time implementation was developed asa MAX/MSP patch with external objects for each of themodules.",

    "abstract": "We propose an environment that allows users to create music by leveraging playful visualization and organic interaction. Our attempt to improve ideas drawn from traditional sequencer paradigm has been made in terms of extemporizing music and associating with visualization in real-time. In order to offer different user experience and musical possibility, this system incorporates many techniques, including; flocking simulation, nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), score file analysis, vector calculation, OpenGL animation, and networking. We transform a sequencer into an audiovisual platform for composition and performance, which is furnished with artistry and ease of use. Thus we believe that it is suitable for not only artists such as algorithmic composers or audiovisual performers, but also anyone who wants to play music and imagery in a different way.",

It is a \"hands free\" instrument, utilizing a non-contact tactile feedback method based on airborne ultrasound. The three main elements/components of the interface that will be discussed in this paper are: 1. Generation of audible sound by self-demodulation of an ultrasound signal during its propagation through air; 2. The condensation of the ultrasound energy in one spatial point generating a precise tactile reproduction of the audible sound; and 3. The feed-forward method enabling a real-time intervention of the musician, by shaping the tactile (ultra)sound directly with his hands.",

Creators of new computerbased instruments face similar design challenges as those in HCI. In the course of creating a new piece for Mobile Phone Orchestra we propose the metaphor of a sound as a ball and explore the interactions and sound mappings it suggests. These lead to the design of a gesture-controlled instrument that allows players to \"bounce\" sounds, \"throw\" them to other players, and compete in a game to \"knock out\" others’ sounds. We composed the piece SoundBounce based on these interactions, and note that audiences seem to find performances of the piece accessible and engaging, perhaps due to the visibility of the metaphor.",

As composers explore this medium it has become evident that the nature of spatial sound perception is complex. Yet interfaces for spatial composition are often simplistic and the end results can be disappointing. This paper presents an interface that is designed to liberate the composer from thinking of spatialised sound as points in space. Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time.",

The increased presence of multichannel devices, along with the high sampling frequency, makesthe sound card desirable as a generic interface for acquisition of analog signals in prototyping of sensor-based musicinterfaces. However, due to the need for coupling capacitorsat a sound card’s inputs and outputs, the use as a genericsignal interface of a sound card is limited to signals not carrying information in a constant DC component. Through arevisit of a card design for the (now defunct) ISA bus, thispaper proposes use of analog gates for bypassing the DCfiltering input sections, controllable from software - therebyallowing for arbitrary choice by the user, if a soundcardinput channel is to be used as a generic analog-to-digitalsensor interface. Issues regarding use of obsolete technology and educational aspects are discussed as well.",

We explore three possible mechanisms how to get impact forces on mobile multi-touch devices: using built-in accelerometers, the pressure sensing capability of Android phones, and external force sensing resistors. We find that accelerometers are difficult to control for this purpose. Android’s pressure sensing shows some promise, especially when combined with augmented playing technique. Force sensing resistors can offer good dynamic resolution but this technology is not currently offered in commodity devices and proper coupling of the sensor with the applied impact is difficult.",

We use qualitative andquantitative data to study and characterise the musician’sinteraction with each other and the software. We show thatwhen made available to them, participants make extensiveuse of a private working area to develop musical contributions before they are introduced to the group. We also arguethat our awareness mechanisms change the perceived quality of the musical interaction, but have no impact on theway musicians interact with the software. We then reflecton implications for the design of new collaborative musicmaking tools which exploit the potential of digital technologies, while at the same time support creative musicalinteraction.",

Our implementations privilege syncretic systems allowing one to explore combinations(hybrids) of disparate elements of a data set through theirplacement in a 2-D space. The first approach allows for theplacement of data points anywhere on the plane accordingto an anticipated performance strategy. The contribution(weight) of each data point varies according to a power function of the distance from the control cursor. The secondapproach uses constrained vertex colored triangulations ofmanifolds with labels placed at the vertices of triangulartiles. Weights are computed by barycentric projection ofthe control cursor position.",

    "abstract": "Pressure, motion, and gesture are important parameters inmusical instrument playing. Pressure sensing allows to interpret complex hidden forces, which appear during playinga musical instrument. The combination of our new sensorsetup with pattern recognition techniques like the lately developed ordered means models allows fast and precise recognition of highly skilled playing techniques. This includes leftand right hand analysis as well as a combination of both. Inthis paper we show bow position recognition for string instruments by means of support vector regression machineson the right hand finger pressure, as well as bowing recognition and inaccurate playing detection with ordered meansmodels. We also introduce a new left hand and chin pressuresensing method for coordination and position change analysis. Our methods in combination with our audio, video,and gesture recording software can be used for teachingand exercising. Especially studies of complex movementsand finger force distribution changes can benefit from suchan approach. Practical applications include the recognitionof inaccuracy, cramping, or malposition, and, last but notleast, the development of augmented instruments and newplaying techniques.",

The process of transformation and extension of the instrument is informed by ideas concerning the intrinsic communication aspects of musical activities. Decisions taken for designing the instrument and performing with it take into account the hypothesis that there are ontological levels of human reception in music that are related to the intercorporeal. Arguing that it is necessary to encounter resistances for achieving expression, it is suggested that new instrumental development ought to reflect on the concern for keeping the natural connections of live performances.",

A new one-button instrument was designed, with which several musicians were each asked topractice and develop a solo performance. Observations oftrends in attributes of these performances are detailed in relation to participants’ statements in structured interviews.Participants were observed to develop stylistic variationsboth within the domain of activities suggested by the constraint, and by discovering non-obvious techniques througha variety of strategies. Data suggest that stylistic variationsoccurred in spite of perceived constraint, but also becauseof perceived constraint. Furthermore, participants tendedto draw on unique experiences, approaches and perspectivesthat shaped individual performances.",

This paper presents a rule system for articulationderived from late Baroque and early Classic treatises on performance.

The model differentiates globalcharacteristics and local particularities, provides a generalframework for human-like music performances, and, therefore, serves as a basis for further and more complex rulesystems.",

Recentlydiscovered algebraically simple nonlinear third-order differential equations are solved and acoustical descriptors relating to their frequency spectrums are determined accordingto the MPEG-7 specification. A second nonlinearity is thenadded to these equations: a real-time audio signal. Descriptive properties of the complex behaviour of these equationsare then determined as a function of difference tones derived from a Just Intonation scale and the amplitude ofthe audio signal. By using only the real-time audio signalfrom live performer/s as an input the causal relationshipbetween acoustic performance gestures and computer output, including any visual or performer-instruction output,is deterministic even if the chaotic behaviours are not.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an interactive system that uses the body as a generative tool for creating music. We explore innovative ways to make music, create self-awareness, and provide the opportunity for unique, interactive social experiences. The system uses a multi-player game paradigm, where players work together to add layers to a soundscape of three distinct environments. Various sensors and hardware are attached to the body and transmit signals to a workstation, where they are processed using Max/MSP. The game is divided into three levels, each of a different soundscape. The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player’s focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state. The system is currently viewed as an interactive installation piece, but future iterations have potential applications in music therapy, bio games, extended performance art, and as a prototype for new interfaces for musical expression.",

Embedding a variety of sensors inside musical instruments and synchronously recording the sensors’ data along with audio, we gather a database of gestural information from multiple performers, then use machine-learning techniques to recognize which musician is performing. Our multimodal approach (using both audio and sensor data) yields promising performer classification results, which we see as a first step in a larger effort to gain insight into musicians’ practice and technique.",

    "abstract": "This paper articulates an interest in a kind of interactive musical instrument and artwork that defines the mechanisms for instrumental interactivity from the iconic morphologies of \"ready-mades\", casting historical utilitarian objects as the basis for performed musical experiences by spectators. The interactive repertoires are therefore partially pre-determined through enculturated behaviors that are associated with particular objects, but more importantly, inextricably linked to the thematic and meaningful assemblage of the work itself. Our new work epi-thet gathers data from individual interactions with common microscopes placed on platforms within a large space. This data is correlated with public domain genetic datasets obtained from micro-array analysis. A sonification algorithm generates unique compositions associated with the spectator \"as measured\" through their individual specification in performing an iconic measurement action. The apparatus is a receptacle for unique compositions in sound, and invites a participatory choreography of stillness that is available for reception as a live musical performance.",

Unfortunately, these devices are still far from being compatible with the audiovisual recording platforms which have been used to record synchronized streams of data. In this paper, we describe a practical solution for simultaneous recording of heterogeneous multimodal signals. The recording system presented uses MIDI Time Code to time-stamp sensor data and to synchronize with standard video and audio recording systems. We also present a set of tools for recording sensor data, as well as a set of analysis tools to evaluate in realtime the sample rate of different signals, and the overall synchronization status of the recording system.",

This foamchanges electrical resistance when deformed; the controllerworks by measuring resistance at multiple points in a single piece of foam in order to track its shape. These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences. Thecontroller achieves its aim of enabling intuitive interaction,but in terms of nuanced interaction, accuracy and repeatability were issues for some participants. It’s not clear fromthe short evaluation study whether these issues would improve with practice, a longitudinal study that gives musicians time to practice and find the creative limitations ofthe controller would help to evaluate this fully.The evaluation highlighted interesting issues concerningthe high level nature of malleable control and different approaches to sonic exploration.",

Sensory supplementation devices can provide us with unique opportunities to investigate the different aspects of our agency by enabling new modes of perception and facilitating the emergence of novel interactions, all of which is impossible without the aforesaid devices. Our preliminary study investigates the non-verbal strategies employed for negotiation of our capacity for action with other bodies and the surrounding space through body-to-body and body-to-space couplings enabled by sensory supplementation devices. We employed a lowfi rapid prototyping approach to build this device, enabling distal perception by sonic and haptic feedback.

The system builds on resistive force feedback, which is achieved through a brakeaugmented ball pen stylus on a sticky touch-sensitive surface. Along the device itself, we present musical interaction principles that are enabled through the aforementioned tactile response. Further variations of the device and perspectives of the friction-based feedback are outlined.",

The goals in developing the sponge were to reintroduce the pleasure of playing and to improve the interaction between the composer/performer and the audience. Ithas been argued that expenditure of effort or energy is required to obtain expressive interfaces. The sponge favors anenergy-sound relationship in two ways : 1) it senses acceleration, which is closely related to energy; and 2) it is madeout of a flexible material (foam) that requires effort to besqueezed or twisted. Some of the mapping strategies usedin a performance context with the sponge are discussed.",

Electromagnetic actuators induce the stringsto vibration, allowing each note to be continuously controlled in amplitude, frequency, and timbre without external loudspeakers. Feedback from a single pickup on thepiano soundboard allows the actuator waveforms to remainlocked in phase with the natural motion of each string. Wealso present an augmented piano keyboard which reportsthe continuous position of every key. Time and spatial resolution are sufficient to capture detailed data about keypress, release, pretouch, aftertouch, and other extended gestures. The system, which is designed with cost and setupconstraints in mind, seeks to give pianists continuous control over the musical sound of their instrument. The instrument has been used in concert performances, with theelectronically-actuated sounds blending with acoustic instruments naturally and without amplification.",

    "abstract": "The console gaming industry is experiencing a revolution in terms of user control, and a large part to Nintendo’s introduction of the Wii remote. The online open source development community has embraced the Wii remote, integrating the inexpensive technology into numerous applications. Some of the more interesting applications demonstrate how the remote hardware can be leveraged for nonstandard uses. In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote’s infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone.",

The audience for this new interface would be the novice programmer interested in usingmusic as part of the learning experience, though the interface should also be complex enough to benefit experiencedartist-programmers. We collected many ideas from currently available music programming languages and librariesto design and create the new capabilities in Minim. Thebasic mechanisms include chained unit generators, instruments, and notes. In general, one \"patches\" unit generators(for example, oscillators, delays, and envelopes) together inorder to create synthesis algorithms. These algorithms canthen either create continuous sound, or be used in instruments to play notes with specific start time and duration.We have written a base set of unit generators to enablea wide variety of synthesis options, and the capabilities ofthe unit generators, instruments, and Processing allow fora wide range of composition techniques.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of networked audio technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for musicians to improvise with instrumentalists from a diverse range of cultures and disciplines. As network speeds increase and latency is consigned to history, tele-musical collaboration, and in particular improvisation will be shaped by new methodologies that respond to this potential. While networked technologies eliminate distance in physical space, for the remote improviser, this creates a liminality of experience through which their performance is mediated. As a first step in understanding the conditions arising from collaboration in networked audio platforms, this paper will examine selected case studies of improvisation in a variety of networked interfaces. The , , author will examine how platform characteristics and network conditions influence the process of collective improvisation and the methodologies musicians are employing to negotiate their networked experiences.",

The sensors detect the movements of a performer’s hands and arms in a three-dimensional space above them. The interface digitizes the output of the sensors into sets of high precision digital packets, and sends them to a patch running in Pdextended with a sufficiently high bandwidth for performances with almost no computational resource consumption in Pd. The precision, speed, and efficiency of the system enable the sonification of hand gestures in realtime without the need to attach any physical devices to the performer’s body.

Mmmmm presents a novel wayfor DJ to become more interactive with their audience andvise versa. The software developed for the N900 mobilephone utilizes the phones built-in accelerometer sensor andBluetooth audio streaming capabilities to mix and apply effects to music using hand gestures and have the mixed audiostream to Bluetooth speakers, which allows the DJ to moveabout the environment and get familiarized with their audience, turning the experience of DJing into an interactiveand audience engaging process.Mmmmm is designed so that the DJ can utilize handgestures and haptic feedback to help them perform the various tasks involved in DJing (mixing, applying effects, andetc). This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an \"Ambient Tempo Detection mode in which the phones camera isutilized to detect the amount of movement in the environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that shouldbe played. This mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on their performance. The DJ canchoose to utilize these modes of interaction and performance or utilize traditional DJ controls using MmmmmsN900 touch screen based graphics user interface.",

    "abstract": "Since 2007, our research is related to the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot, which it has been designed to imitate the saxophonist playing by mechanically reproducing the organs involved for playing a saxophone. Our research aims in understanding the motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication. In this paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining a sense of personal connection between increasingly synthetic performers and increasingly diffuse audiences is vital to storytelling and entertainment. Sonic intimacy is important, because voice is one of the highestbandwidth channels for expressing our real and imagined selves.New tools for highly focused spatialization could help improve acoustical clarity, encourage audience engagement, reduce noise pollution and inspire creative expression. We have a particular interest in embodied, embedded systems for vocal performance enhancement and transformation. This short paper describes work in progress on a toolkit for high-quality wearable sound suits. Design goals include tailored directionality and resonance, full bandwidth, and sensible ergonomics. Engineering details to accompany a demonstration of recent prototypes are presented, highlighting a novel magnetostrictive flextensional transducer. Based on initial observations we suggest that vocal acoustic output from the torso, and spatial perception of situated low frequency sources, are two areas deserving greater attention and further study.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of composing expressive music using the principles of Fuzzy Logic. The paper provides a conceptual model of a musical work which follows compositional decision making processes. Significant features of this Fuzzy Logic framework are its inclusiveness through the consideration of all the many and varied musical details, while also incorporating the imprecision that characterises musical terminology and discourse. A significant attribute of my Fuzzy Logic method is that it traces the trajectory of all musical details, since it is both the individual elements and their combination over time which is significant to the effectiveness of a musical work in achieving its goals. The goal of this work is to find a set of elements and rules, which will ultimately enable the construction of a genralised algorithmic compositional system which can produce expressive music if so desired.",

The physical form of the interface can easily be reconfigured by simply adding and removing a variety of ferromagnetic objects to the device’s sensing surface. This allows the user to change the physical form of the interface resulting in a variety of different interaction modes. When used in a musical context, the performer can leverage the physical reconfiguration of the device to affect the method of playing and ultimately the sound produced. We describe the implementation of the sensing system, along with a range of mapping techniques used to transform the sensor data into musical output, including both the direct synthesis of sound and also the generation of MIDI data for use with Ableton Live. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for the device.",

The receiver element consists of a radioreceiver connected through a microcontroller to a computerfor real time sound synthesis. The wireless transmission between the sensor elements and the receiver element is basedon the low rate IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee standard.A configuration with several accelerometers connected bywire to a wireless sensor element is compared to using multiple wireless sensor elements with only one accelerometer ineach. The study shows that it would be feasable to connect5-6 accelerometers in the given setups.Sensor data processing can be done in either the receiverelement or in the sensor element. For various reasons it canbe reasonable to implement some sensor data processing inthe sensor element.

The shape of each plate must be determined in the design process so that the metallophone willproduce the proper tone when struck with a mallet. Unfortunately, the relationship between plate shape and tone iscomplex, which makes it difficult to design plates with arbitrary shapes. Our system addresses this problem by runninga concurrent numerical eigenanalysis during interactive geometry editing. It continuously presents a predicted tone tothe user with both visual and audio feedback, thus makingit possible to design a plate with any desired shape and tone.We developed this system to demonstrate the effectivenessof integrating real-time finite element method analysis intogeometric editing to facilitate the design of custom-mademusical instruments.

Embodying this design approach, the Monome OSC/MIDI USB controller represents a minimalist, open-source hardware device. The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of Monome users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device’s original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs.",

The multidimensional structure of the gestures natural for a musical or physical interface may have little obvious relationship to the parameters that a sound synthesis algorithm exposes for control. A common situation arises when there is a nonlinear synthesis technique for which a traditional instrumental interface with quasi-independent control of pitch and expression is desired.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a wireless musical interface driven by grasping forces and human motion. The sounds generated by the traditional digital musical instruments are dependent on the physical shape of the musical instruments. The freedom of the musical performance is restricted by its structure. Therefore, the sounds cannot be generated with the body expression like the dance. We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance.",

Thistrend strongly depends on the high diffusion of laptops,which proved to be powerful and flexible musical devices.However laptops still lack in flexible interface, specificallydesigned for music creation in live and studio performances.To resolve this issue many controllers have been developed,taking into account not only the performer’s needs andhabits during music creation, but also the audience desire tovisually understand how performer’s gestures are linked tothe way music is made. According to the common need ofadaptable visual interface to manipulate music, in this paper we present a custom tridimensional controller, based onOpen Sound Control protocol and completely designed towork inside Virtual Reality: simple geometrical shapes canbe created to directly control loop triggering and parametermodification, just using free hand interaction.",

This is because of important features of IEC,like the ability of optimizing with ambiguous evaluationmeasures, and not requiring special knowledge about artcreation. With the popularity of Consumer Generated Media, many beginners in term of art-creation are interestedin creating their own original art works. Thus developing ofuseful IEC system for musical creation is an urgent task.However, user-assist functions for IEC proposed in pastworks decrease the possibility of getting good unexpectedresults, which is an important feature of art-creation withIEC. In this paper, The , , author proposes a new IEC evaluation process named \"Shopping Basket\" procedure IEC.In the procedure, an user-assist function called SimilarityBased Reasoning allows for natural evaluation by the user.The function reduces user’s burden without reducing thepossibility of unexpected results.

The paper explores the interaction between the human body and real-time media (audio and visual) by the usage of bio-interfaces. This research is based on biofeedback investigations pursued by the psychologist Neal E. Miller in the 1960s, mainly based on finding new methods to reduce stress. However, this article explains and shows examples in which biofeedback research is used for artistic purposes only.",

They engage groups ofperformers to use ordinary laptop computers as instrumentsand sound sources in the performance of specially createdmusic software. Perhaps the biggest challenge for LOs isthe distribution, management and control of software acrossheterogeneous collections of networked computers. Software must be stored and distributed from a central repository, but launched on individual laptops immediately beforeperformance. The GRENDL project leverages proven gridcomputing frameworks and approaches the Laptop Orchestra as a distributed computing platform for interactive computer music. This allows us to readily distribute softwareto each laptop in the orchestra depending on the laptop’sinternal configuration, its role in the composition, and theplayer assigned to that computer. Using the SAGA framework, GRENDL is able to distribute software and managesystem and application environments for each composition.Our latest version includes tangible control of the GRENDLenvironment for a more natural and familiar user experience.",

After introducing some of the challenges in the field of Generative Art and placing the work within its research context, conceptual reflections are made about the spatial, behavioural, perceptual and social issues that are raised within the entire installation. A discussion about the artistic content follows, focussing on the scenography and on working with flocking algorithms in general, before addressing three specific pieces realised for the exhibition. Next the technical implementation for both hardand software are detailed before the idea of a hybrid ecosystem gets discussed and further developments outlined.",

This paper looks at the technical and compositional methodologies used in the realization of the work, in particular, the choices made with regard to the mapping of sensor elements to various spatialization functions. Kinaesonics will be discussed in relation to the coding of real-time one-to-one mapping of sound to gesture and its expression in terms of hardware and software design. Four forms of expressivity arising out of interactive work with the Bodycoder system will be identified. How sonic (electro-acoustic), programmed, gestural (kinaesonic) and in terms of the V’Oct(Ritual) vocal expressivities are constructed as pragmatic and tangible elements within the compositional practice will be discussed and the subsequent importance of collaboration with a performer will be exposed.",

    "abstract": "The article describes a flexible mapping technique realized as a many-to-many dynamic mapping matrix. Digital sound generation is typically controlled by a large number of parameters and efficient and flexible mapping is necessary to provide expressive control over the instrument. The proposed modulation matrix technique may be seen as a generic and selfmodifying mapping mechanism integrated in a dynamic interpolation scheme. It is implemented efficiently by taking advantage of its inherent sparse matrix structure. The modulation matrix is used within the Hadron Particle Synthesizer, a complex granular module with 200 synthesis parameters and a simplified performance control structure with 4 expression parameters.",

In this paper we present an interactive installation, where we expand the role of the instrument to motivate musicking and cocreation between diverse users. We have made an open installation, where users can perform a variety of actions in several situations. By using the abilities of the computer, we have made an installation, which can be interpreted to have many roles. It can both be an instrument, a co-musician, a communication partner, a toy, a meeting place and an ambient musical landscape. The users can dynamically shift between roles, based on their abilities, knowledge and motivation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present an experimental study concerninggestural embodiment of environmental sounds in a listeningcontext. The presented work is part of a project aiming atmodeling movement-sound relationships, with the end goalof proposing novel approaches for designing musical instruments and sounding objects. The experiment is based onsound stimuli corresponding to \"causal\" and \"non-causal\"sounds. It is divided into a performance phase and an interview. The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the \"causality\" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds’ causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that\"mimic\" a sound’s cause and gestures that \"trace\" a sound’smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound \"contours\". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.",

To do this, audio engineers employ\"panpots\" and faders, the standard controls in audio mixers. The design of such devices has remained practically unchanged for decades since their introduction. At the time,no usability studies seem to have been conducted on suchdevices, so one could question if they are really optimizedfor the task they are meant for.This paper proposes a new set of controls that might beused to simplify and/or improve the performance of audiomixing tasks, taking into account the spatial characteristicsof modern mixing technologies such as surround and 3Daudio and making use of multitouch interface technologies.A preliminary usability test has shown promising results.",

HIDUINO was developed in conjunction with a class at the California Institute of the Arts intended to teach introductory-level human-computer and human-robot interaction within the context of musical controllers. We describe our frustration with existing microcontroller platforms and our experiences using the new firmware to facilitate the development and prototyping of new music controllers.",

    "abstract": "A contemporary PC user, typically expects a sound cardto be a piece of hardware, that: can be manipulated by’audio’ software (most typically exemplified by ’media players’); and allows interfacing of the PC to audio reproduction and/or recording equipment. As such, a ’sound card’can be considered to be a system, that encompasses designdecisions on both hardware and software levels – that also demand a certain understanding of the architecture of thetarget PC operating system.This project outlines how an Arduino Duemillanoveboard (containing a USB interface chip, manufactured byFuture Technology Devices International Ltd \\[FTDI\\]company) can be demonstrated to behave as a full-duplex,mono, 8-bit 44.1 kHz soundcard, through an implementation of: a PC audio driver for ALSA (Advanced LinuxSound Architecture); a matching program for theArduino’sATmega microcontroller – and nothing more than headphones (and a couple of capacitors). The main contributionof this paper is to bring a holistic aspect to the discussionon the topic of implementation of soundcards – also by referring to open-source driver, microcontroller code and testmethods; and outline a complete implementation of an open – yet functional – soundcard system.",

Through my background as a guitarist and composer in an experimental metal band I have experienced a vast development in music technology during the last 20 years. This development has made a great impact in changing the procedures for composing and producing music within my genre without necessarily changing the strategies of how the technology is used. The transition from analogue to digital sound technology not only opened up new ways of manipulating and manoeuvring sound, it also opened up challenges in how to integrate and control the digital sound technology as a seamless part of my musical genre. By using techniques and methods known from electro-acoustic/computer music, and adapting them for use within my tradition, this research aims to find new strategies for composing and producing music within my genre.",

Blowing pressure signalsare captured from real performance by means of a a lowintrusiveness acquisition system constructed around commercial pressure sensors based on piezoelectric transducers.An alto recorder was mechanically modified by a luthierto allow the measurement and connection of sensors whilerespecting playability and intrusiveness. A multi-modaldatabase including aligned blowing pressure and sound signals is constructed from real practice, covering the performance space by considering different fundamental frequencies, dynamics, articulations and note durations. Once signals were pre-processed and segmented, a set of temporalenvelope features were defined as a basis for studying andconstructing a simplified model of blowing pressure profilesin different performance contexts.",

    "abstract": "We conducted three studies with contemporary music composers at IRCAM. We found that even highly computer-literate composers use an iterative process that begins with expressing musical ideas on paper, followed by active parallel exploration on paper and in software, prior to final execution of their ideas as an original score. We conducted a participatory design study that focused on the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a technology probe that connects users’ hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically.",

    "abstract": "Popular music (characterized by improvised instrumental parts, beat and measure-level organization, and steady tempo) poses challenges for human-computer music performance (HCMP). Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music performance by computer.",

In an initial study of what it is that constitutes play fluency in improvisation, a music game has been designed and evaluated through video analysis: A qualitative view of mutual action describes the social context of music improvisation: how two people with speech, laughter, gestures, postures and pauses negotiate individual and joint action. The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative music improvisation games towards ways of mutual play.",

Creating a multi-dimensional, expressive instrument was the primary driving force. For these criteria the pedal steel guitar proved an apt model as it allows control over several instrument parameters simultaneously and continuously. The parameters we wanted control over were volume, timbre, release time and pitch.The Quadrofeelia is played with two hands on a horizontal surface. Single notes and melodies are easily played as well as chordal accompaniment with a variety of timbres and release times enabling a range of legato and staccato notes in an intuitive manner with a new yet familiar interface.",

Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade we have seen a growing presence of tabletop systems applied to music, lately with even some products becoming commercially available and being used byprofessional musicians in concerts. The development of thistype of applications requires several demanding technicalexpertises such as input processing, graphical design, realtime sound generation or interaction design, and because ofthis complexity they are usually developed by a multidisciplinary group.In this paper we present the Musical Tabletop CodingFramework (MTCF) a framework for designing and codingmusical tabletop applications by using the graphical programming language for digital sound processing Pure Data(Pd). With this framework we try to simplify the creationprocess of such type of interfaces, by removing the need ofany programming skills other than those of Pd.",

Inparticular, we focus on networks that are responsible for thegeneration of rhythmic patterns.The interface relies uponthe idea of relating metaphorically neural behaviors to electronic and acoustic instruments notes, by means of flexiblemapping strategies. The user can intuitively design network configurations by dynamically creating neurons andconfiguring their inter-connectivity. The core of the systemis based in events emerging from his network design, whichfunctions in a similar way to what happens in real smallneural networks. Having multiple signal and data inputsand outputs, as well as standard communications protocolssuch as MIDI, OSC and TCP/IP, it becomes and uniquetool for composers and performers, suitable for different performance scenarios, like live electronics, sound installationsand telematic concerts.",

This interactive installation is based on the function ofan ordinary object that is not a traditional instrument, andhanging articles of clothing is literally the gesture to use theinterface. Based on this metaphor, a musical interface withhigh transparency was designed. Using the metaphor, weexplored the possibilities for recognizing of input gesturesand creating sonic events by mapping data to sound. Thus,four different types of Airer Choir were developed. By classifying the interfaces, we concluded that various musicalexpressions are possible by using the same metaphor.",

    "abstract": "We developed a kinetic particles synthesizer for mobile devices having a multi-touch screen such as a tablet PC and a smart phone. This synthesizer generates music based on the kinetics of particles under a two-dimensional physics engine. The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction, restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated. A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone. However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment.",

The participants can choose to actively manipulateor passively convey their cognitive state depending on theirdesired approach and experience level. A four-channel electronic music mixture continuously conveys the participants’expressed cognitive states while a colored visualization oftheir locations on a two-dimensional projection of cognitive state attributes aids their navigation through the space.MoodMixer is a collaborative experience that incorporatesaspects of both passive and active EEG sonification andperformance art. We discuss the technical design of the installation and place its collaborative sonification aestheticdesign within the context of existing EEG-based music andart.",

    "abstract": "Computer music systems that coordinate or interact with human musicians exist in many forms. Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of \"beat\" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document.",

    "abstract": "The DJ culture uses a gesture lexicon strongly rooted in thetraditional setup of turntables and a mixer. As novel toolsare introduced in the DJ community, this lexicon is adaptedto the features they provide. In particular, multitouch technologies can offer a new syntax while still supporting the oldlexicon, which is desired by DJs.We present a classification of DJ tools, from an interaction point of view, that divides the previous work into Traditional, Virtual and Hybrid setups. Moreover, we presenta multitouch tabletop application, developed with a groupof DJ consultants to ensure an adequate implementation ofthe traditional gesture lexicon.To conclude, we conduct an expert evaluation, with tenDJ users in which we compare the three DJ setups with ourprototype. The study revealed that our proposal suits expectations of Club/Radio-DJs, but fails against the mentalmodel of Scratch-DJs, due to the lack of haptic feedback torepresent the record’s physical rotation. Furthermore, testsshow that our multitouch DJ setup, reduces task durationwhen compared with Virtual setups.",

    "abstract": "The use of physiological signals in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is becoming popular and widespread, mostlydue to sensors miniaturization and advances in real-timeprocessing. However, most of the studies that use physiologybased interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and itsusage in collaborative scenarios is still in its beginning. Inthis paper we explore how interactive sonification of brainand heart signals, and its representation through physicalobjects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhancemotivational and controlling aspects of music collaboration.A multimodal system is presented, based on an electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface. Performance and motivation variables wereassessed in an experiment involving a test \"Physio\" group(N=22) and a control \"Placebo\" group (N=10). Pairs ofparticipants used two methods for sound creation: implicitinteraction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The resultsshowed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control thanthe Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it. These results support the feasibilityof introducing physiology-based interaction in multimodalinterfaces for collaborative music generation.",

    "abstract": "The use of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental arts is not a novel concept. Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one’s mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware.",

    "abstract": "Many performers of novel musical instruments find it difficult to engage audiences beyond those in the field. Previousresearch points to a failure to balance complexity with usability, and a loss of transparency due to the detachmentof the controller and sound generator. The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience’s lack of prior exposure to theinstrument and its workings.However, we argue that there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are intendedto be both a tool for creative expression and a creative workof art in themselves, resulting in incompatible requirements.By considering the instrument, the composition and theperformance together as a whole with careful considerationof the rate of learning demanded of the audience, we propose that a lack of transparency can become an asset ratherthan a hindrance. Our approach calls for not only controllerand sound generator to be designed in sympathy with eachother, but composition, performance and physical form too.Identifying three design principles, we illustrate this approach with the Serendiptichord, a wearable instrument fordancers created by the , , authors.",

    "abstract": "The Overtone Fiddle is a new violin-family instrument that incorporates electronic sensors, integrated DSP, and physical actuation of the acoustic body. An embedded tactile sound transducer creates extra vibrations in the body of the Overtone Fiddle, allowing performer control and sensation via both traditional violin techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared man/machine control of the resulting sound. A magnetic pickup system is mounted to the end of the fiddle’s fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded in the body of the instrument back to the pickup.",

Sincethe system provides OSC and MIDI compatibility, alternative electronic instruments can be used as well. The audiosignals are then sent back wirelessly to audio-tactile excitersembedded in the sandals’ sole, and optionally to headphonesand external loudspeakers.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the motivation and construction ofGamelan Elektrika, a new electronic gamelan modeled aftera Balinese Gong Kebyar. The first of its kind, Elektrika consists of seven instruments acting as MIDI controllers accompanied by traditional percussion and played by 11 or moreperformers following Balinese performance practice. Threemain percussive instrument designs were executed using acombination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original, the sound andtravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyondthe quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds.It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taughttradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creatingopportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar’s enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness inBalinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles,Elek Trika challenges performers to trust silent instrumentsand develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, butthrough the sound of the whole.",

EGGS was introduced in a previous edition of this conference. The works presented include interactive installations in the form of public art and interactive onstage performances. In all of the works, the EGGS principles of simplicity based on the correspondence between elementary sonic and movement units, and of organicity between sound and gesture are applied. Indeed, we study both sound as a means for gesture representation and gesture as embodiment of sound. These principles constitute our guidelines for the investigation of the bidirectional relationship between sound and body expression with various strategies involving both educated and non-educated executors.",

    "abstract": "The Bass Sleeve uses an Arduino board with a combination of buttons, switches, flex sensors, force sensing resistors, and an accelerometer to map the ancillary movements of a performer to sampling, real-time audio and video processing including pitch shifting, delay, low pass filtering, and onscreen video movement. The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance. In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing, sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia musical performance piece.",

After the description of the methods and tools used in a series of measurements, two types of data-display are shown and the applied in the interpretation. One salient feature is recognized and put into perspective with regards to movement and gestalt perception.

Using the Wekinator software for interactive machine learning, we have created discrete and continuous models for controlling audio and visual environments using human gestures sensed by a commercially-available sensor bow and the Microsoft Kinect. In particular, we have employed machine learning to quickly and easily prototype complex relationships between performer gesture and performative outcome.",

The generated rhythms are \"generic\" in the sense that they are characteristic of each time signature without belonging to a specific musical style. The algorithm is based on a stochastic model in which various aspects and qualities of the generated rhythm can be controlled intuitively and in real time. Such qualities are the density of the generated events per bar, the amount of variation in generation, the amount of syncopation, the metrical strength, and of course the meter itself. The kin.rhythmicator software application was developed to implement this algorithm. During a performance with the kin.rhythmicator the user can control all aspects of the performance through descriptive and intuitive graphic controls.",

One of the persistent problems in theseapplications is generating, identifying and choosing inputoutput pairings for training. This poses problems of scope(limiting the realm of potential control inputs), effort (requiring significant pre-performance training time), and cognitive load (forcing the performer to learn and remember thecontrol areas). We discuss the creation and implementationof an automatic \"supervisor,\" using unsupervised machinelearning algorithms to train a supervised neural networkon the fly. This hierarchical arrangement enables networktraining in real time based on the musical or gestural control inputs employed in a performance, aiming at freeing theperformer to operate in a creative, intuitive realm, makingthe machine control transparent and automatic. Three implementations of this self supervised model driven by iPod,iPad, and acoustic violin are described.",

In addition to these hexagonal sensors, the Manta has two high-dimension touch sliders (giving 12-bit values), and four assignable function buttons.

Finite Difference (FD) methods can be the basis for physics-based music instrument models that generate realistic audio output. However, such methods are compute-intensive; large simulations cannot run in real time on current CPUs. Many current systems now include powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are a good fit for FD methods. We demonstrate that it is possible to use this method to create a usable real-time audio synthesizer.",

    "abstract": "Interacting with musical avatars have been increasingly popular over the years, with the introduction of games likeGuitar Hero and Rock Band. These games provide MIDIequipped controllers that look like their real-world counterparts (e.g. MIDI guitar, MIDI drumkit) that the users playto control their designated avatar in the game. The performance of the user is measured against a score that needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking. The system uses an artificial intelligence approach to implement imitation learning,employing artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "We developed very small and light sensors, each equippedwith 3-axes accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes.Those MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors allow for a drift-free attitude computation which in turnleads to the possibility of recovering the skeleton of bodyparts that are of interest for the performance, improvingthe results of gesture recognition and allowing to get relative position between the extremities of the limbs and thetorso of the performer. This opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed atARTeM \\[2\\]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player, toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that would disturb the performer. Weused those sensors in several performances with a dancingviola player and in one where she was simultaneously controlling gas flames interactively. We are currently applyingthem to other types of musical performances.",

    "abstract": "Haptic interfaces using active force-feedback have mostly been used for emulating existing instruments and making conventional music. With the right speed, force, precision and software they can also be used to make new sounds and perhaps new music. The requirements are local microprocessors (for low-latency and high update rates), strategic sensors (for force as well as position), and non-linear dynamics (that make for rich overtones and chaotic music).",

    "abstract": "The goal of our research is to find ways of supporting and encouraging musical behavior by non-musicians in shared public performance environments. Previous studies indicated simultaneous music listening and performance is difficult for non-musicians, and that visual support for the task might be helpful. This paper presents results from a preliminary user study conducted to evaluate the effect of visual feedback on a musical tracking task. Participants generated a musical signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter, but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously decreases performance in both dimensions.",

This interface enables users to control and interact with the game console without the need to touch a controller. It largely increases the users’ degree of freedom to express their emotion. In this paper, we first describe the system we developed to use this interface for sound generation and controlling musical expression. The skeleton data are extracted from users’ motions and the data are translated to pre-defined MIDI data. We then use the MIDI data to control several applications. To allow the translation between the data, we implemented a simple Kinect-to-MIDI data convertor, which is introduced in this paper. We describe two applications to make music with Kinect: we first generate sound with Max/MSP, and then control the adlib with our own adlib generating system by the body movements of the users.",

This system relies on three pervasive technologies that each support a different part of the musical experience. First, the mobile device application for performing with an artificial voice, called ChoirMob. Then, a central composing and conducting application running on a local interactive display, called Vuzik. Finally, a network protocol to synchronize the two. ChoirMob musicians can perform music together at any location where they can connect to a Vuzik central conducting device displaying a composed piece of music. We explored this system by creating a chamber choir of ChoirMob performers, consisting of both experienced musicians and novices, that performed in rehearsals and live concert scenarios with music composed using the Vuzik interface.",

The AuRal environment binds physical location and the choices of multiple, simultaneous performers to act as the generative force of music tied to the region. Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music. As a result, walking through the same location at different times results in unique collaborative listening experiences.",

    "abstract": "In site-specific installation or situated media, a significant part of the \"I\" in NIME is the environment, the site and the implicit features of site such as humans, weather, materials, natural acoustics, etc. These could be viewed as design constraints, or features, even agency determining the outcome of responsive sound installation works. This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors’ Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and ‘site’ as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.",

    "abstract": "As a part of the research project Voice Meetings, a solo live-electronic vocal performance was presented for 63 students. Through a mixed method approach applying both written and oral response, feedback from one blindfolded and one seeing audience group was collected and analyzed. There were marked differences between the groups regarding focus, in that the participants in blindfolded group tended to focus on fewer aspects, have a heightened focus and be less distracted than the seeing group. The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions. This study also shows that there were only minor differences between the groups regarding the experience of skill and control, and argues that this observation can be explained by earlier research on skill in NIMEs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that the design of New Interfaces for Musical Expression has much to gain from the study of interaction in ensemble laptop performance contexts using ethnographic techniques. Inspired by recent third-stream research in the field of human computer interaction, we describe a recent ethnomethodologically-informed study of the Birmingham Laptop Ensemble (BiLE), and detail our approach to thick description of the group’s working practices. Initial formal analysis of this material sheds light on the fluidity of composer, performer and designer roles within the ensemble and shows how confluences of these roles constitute member’s differing viewpoints. We go on to draw out a number of strands of interaction that highlight the essentially complex, socially constructed and value driven nature of the group’s practice and conclude by reviewing the implications of these factors on the design of software tools for laptop ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Tangible tabletop musical interfaces allowing for a collabo-rative real-time interaction in live music performances are one of the promising fields in NIMEs. At present, this kind of interfaces present at least some of the following charac-teristics that limit their musical use: latency in the inter-action, and partial or complete lack of responsiveness to gestures such as tapping, scrubbing or pressing force. Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction with this kind of interfaces, and in particular with the tangible tabletop instrument Reactable . In this paper we present a system based on a circular array of me-chanically intercoupled force sensing resistors used to obtain a low-latency, affordable, and easily embeddable hardware system able to detect surface impacts and pressures on the tabletop perimeter. We also consider the option of com-pleting this detected gestural information with the sound information coming from a contact microphone attached to the mechanical coupling layer, to control physical modelling synthesis of percussion instruments.",

The system uses electromagnetic actuators to induce vibrations in the vibraphone’s aluminum tone bars. The tone bars and the electromagnetic actuators are coupled via neodymium magnets affixed to each bar. The acoustic properties of the vibraphone allowed us to develop a very simple, low-cost and powerful amplification solution that requires no heat sinking. The physical design is meant to be portable and robust, and the system can be easily installed on any vibraphone without interfering with normal performance techniques. The system supports multiple in-terfacing solutions, affording the performer and composer the ability to interact with the EMvibe in different ways depending on the musical context.",

    "abstract": "In the following paper we propose a new tiered granularity approach to developing modules or abstractions in the Pd-L2Ork visual multimedia programming environment with the specific goal of devising creative environments that scale their educational scope and difficulty to encompass several stages within the context of primary and secondary (K-12) education. As part of a preliminary study, the team designed modules targeting 4th and 5th grade students, the primary focus being exploration of creativity and collaborative learning. The resulting environment infrastructure -coupled with the Boys & Girls Club of Southwest Virginia Satellite Linux Laptop Orchestra -offers opportunities for students to design and build original instruments, master them through a series of rehearsals, and ultimately utilize them as part of an ensemble in a performance of a predetermined piece whose parameters are coordinated by instructor through an embedded networked module. The ensuing model will serve for the assessment and development of a stronger connection with content-area standards and the development of creative thinking and collaboration skills.",

While the system plays an accompaniment background chord progression, each participant plays some kind of controller to make music through the system. The program takes the signals from the controllers and adjusts the pitches somewhat so that the players are limited to notes which fit the chord progression. The various controllers are designed to be very easy and intuitive so anyone can pick one up and quickly be able to play it. Since the computer is making sure that wrong notes are avoided, even inexperienced players can immediately make music and enjoy focusing on some of the more expressive elements and thus become musicians.",

The system makes use of a combination of real-time audio analysis, live sampling and spectral re-synthesis to build a vocabulary of possible performative responses to live instrumental input throughout an improvisatory performance. A form of timbral matching is employed to form a link between the live performer and an expanding database of musical materials. In addition, the system takes into account the unique nature of the rehearsal/practice space in musical performance through the implementation of performer-configurable cumulative rehearsal databases into the final design. This paper discusses the system in detail with reference to related work in the field, making specific reference to the system’s interactive potential both inside and outside of a real-time performance context.",

In this paper, we describe a novel interaction that we used in the frame of this project: using the dancer’s movements to recognize the emotions he expresses, and use these emotions to generate musical audio flows evolving in real-time. The originality of this interaction is threefold. First, it covers the whole interaction cycle from the input (the dancer’s movements) to the output (the generated music). Second, this interaction isn’t direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer’s emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.",

    "abstract": "I present a novel low-tech multidimensional gestural con-troller, based on the resistive properties of a 2D field of pencil markings on paper. A set of movable electrodes (+, -, ground) made from soldered stacks of coins create a dynamic voltage potential field in the carbon layer, and an-other set of movable electrodes tap voltages from this field. These voltages are used to control complex sound engines in an analogue modular synthesizer. Both the voltage field and the tap electrodes can be moved freely. The design was inspired by previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is cheap to build, and provides flexible control over a large set of parameters. It is musically satisfying to play, and allows for a wide range of playing techniques, from wild exploration to subtle expressions. I also present an inven-tory of the available playing techniques, motivated by the interface design, musically, conceptually and theatrically. The performance aspects of the interface are also discussed. The interface has been used in a number of performances in Sweden and Japan in 2011, and is also used by other musicians.",

We show that reinforcement learning can incrementally learn percussive beat patterns played by humans and supports realtime collaborative performance in the absence of one or more performers. This work leverages an existing integration between urMus and Soar and addresses multiple challenges involved in the deployment of machine-learning algorithms for mobile music expression, including tradeoffs between learning speed & quality; interface design for human collaborators; and real-time performance and improvisation.",

    "abstract": "Performing music with a computer and loudspeakers represents always a challenge. The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance. The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer’s muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the design and testing of a reactive envi-ronment for musical performance. Driven by the interpersonal in-teractions amongst musicians, our system gives users, i.e., several musicians playing together in a band, real-time control over certain aspects of their performance, enabling them to change volume lev-els dynamically simply by moving around. It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical in-terfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, draw-ing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sci-ences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances tra-ditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.",

    "abstract": "Sound generators and synthesis engines expose a large set of parameters, allowing run-time timbre morphing and exploration of sonic space. However, control over these high-dimensional interfaces is constrained by the physical limitations of performers. In this paper we propose the exploitation of vocal gesture as an extension or alternative to traditional physical controllers. The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer’s real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.",

A new Open Sound Control (OSC) namespace called Nexus Data Exchange Format (NDEF) streamlines message mapping by offering developers the ability to manage sound engines as network nodes and to query those nodes for the messages in their OSC address spaces. By using NDEF, developers will have an eas-ier time managing nodes and their messages, especially for scenarios in which a single application or interface controls multiple sound engines. NDEF is currently implemented in the JunctionBox interaction toolkit but could easily be implemented in other toolkits.",

The device uses capacitive sensing to detect proximity of the player’s body to the metal object, and sound is generated through a surface transducer which can be attached to any flat surface. Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel music control sensate surface, which enables integration between any musical instruments with a v ersatile, customizable, and essentially cost-effective user interface. This sensate surface is based on c onductive inkjet printing technology which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and connections between electronics components to be printed onto a large roll of flexible substrate that is unrestricted in length. The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can “cut” out their desired shapes, “paste” the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one’s music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.",

    "abstract": "From a technical point of view, instrumental music mak-ing involves audible, visible and hidden playing parameters. Hidden parameters like force, pressure and fast movements, happening within milliseconds are particularly difficult to capture. Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow’s position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Pottery is an interactive audiovisual piece that uses hand gesture to create 3D pottery objects and sound shape. Using the OptiTrack motion capture (Rigid Body) system at TransLab in UCSB, performers can take a glove with attached trackers, move the hand in x, y, and z axis and create their own sound pieces. Performers can also manipulate their pottery pieces in real time and change arrangement on the musical score interface in order to create a continuous musical composition. In this paper we address the relationship between body, sound and 3D shapes. We also describe the origin of Virtual Pottery, its design process, discuss its aesthetic value and musical sound synthesis system, and evaluate the overall experience.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of user interaction with two explorative music environments (sound system A and B) that were inspired from the Banda Linda music tradition in two different ways. The sound systems adapted to how a team of two players improvised and made a melody together in an interleaved fashion: Systems A and B used a fuzzy logic algorithm and pattern recognition to respond with modifications of a background rhythms. In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other’s melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ”listening applications”.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of a new method for approaching beat sequencing. As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of \"Master Beats\". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual \"sink\". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.",

    "abstract": "The Physical Computing Ensemble was created in order to determine the viability of an approach to musical performance which focuses on the relationships and interactions of the performers. Three performance systems utilizing gestural controllers were designed and implemented, each with a different strategy for performer interaction. These strategies took advantage of the opportunities for collaborative performance inherent in digital musical instruments due to their networking abilities and reconfigurable software. These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems. The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.",

    "abstract": "The configurability and networking abilities of digital musical instruments increases the possibilities for collaboration in musical performances. Computer music ensembles such as laptop orchestras are becoming increasingly common and provide laboratories for the exploration of these possibilities. However, much of the literature regarding the creation of DMIs has been focused on individual expressivity, and their potential for collaborative performance has been under-utilized. This paper makes the case for the benefits of an approach to digital musical instrument design that begins with their collaborative potential, examines several frameworks and sets of principles for the creation of digital musical instruments, and proposes a dimension space representation of collaborative approaches which can be used to evaluate and guide future DMI creation. Several examples of DMIs and compositions are then evaluated and discussed in the context of this dimension space.",

    "abstract": "Mapping between musical interfaces, and sound engines, is integral to the nature of an interface \\[3\\]. Traditionally, musical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work \\[9\\] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an ‘anchor’ to create a local coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer’s small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares \\[9\\] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces \\[1\\].",

Compass-based interface can detect the aiming orientation of performers on stage, allowing us to obtain information on interactions between performers and use it for both musical mappings and visualizations on screen for the audience. We document and discuss the result of a compass-based mobile music performance, Where Are You Standing, and present an algorithm for a new app to track down the performers’ positions in real-time.",

    "abstract": "As a 2010 Artist in Residence in Musical Research at IRCAM, Mari Kimura used the Augmented Violin to develop new compositional approaches, and new ways of creating interactive performances \\[1\\]. She contributed her empirical and historical knowledge of violin bowing technique, working with the Real Time Musical Interactions Team at IRCAM. Thanks to this residency, her ongoing long-distance collaboration with the team since 2007 dramatically accelerated, and led to solving several compositional and calibration issues of the Gesture Follower (GF) \\[2\\]. Kimura was also the first artist to develop projects between the two teams at IRCAM, using OMAX (Musical Representation Team) with GF. In the past year, the performance with Augmented Violin has been expanded in larger scale interactive audio/visual projects as well. In this paper, we report on the various techniques developed for the Augmented Violin and compositions by Kimura using them, offering specific examples and scores.",

We introduce design concerns that we consider influential to enhance the communication flow between the audience and the performer. We also propose and put in practice a design approach that considers the use of performance space as a way to engage with the audience. A collaborative project, Sound Gloves, presented here exemplifies such a concept by dissolving the space between performers and audience. Our approach resulted in a continuous interaction between audience and performers, in which the social dynamics was changed in a positive way in a live performance context of NIMEs. Such an approach, we argue, may be considered as one way to further engage and interact with the audience.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to improve the correspondence between music and dance, and explores the use of human respiration pattern for musical applications with focus on the motional aspect of breathing. While respiration is frequently considered as an indicator of the metabolic state of human body that contains meaningful information for medicine or psychology, motional aspect of respiration has been relatively unnoticed in spite of its strong correlation with muscles and the brain. This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer’s respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.",

He was never able to perform the piece with those forces, however, due to his inability to synchronize multiple pianolas. Thus all performances of the piece in his lifetime, and for decades after, were done with a single pianola or player piano.\\* The author traces the origin of the concept of synchronizing multiple pianolas, and explains the attendant technological issues. He examines attempts to synchronize mechanical pianos and other time-based devices at the time of Ballet mécanique’s composition, and suggests that Antheil’s vision for his piece was not as farfetched as has long been thought.",

The sounds are transduced by a piezoelectric sensor inside the wooden body, so any tactile contact with TedStick is transmitted as audio and further processed by a computer. The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it-self. This is done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo-cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.",

The Aesthetic Experience Prism makes use of Arthur Danto’s framework of aesthetic experience that consists of three conceptual entities: (1) metaphor; (2) expression; and (3) style. In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities. In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model’s of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the Musician Assistance and Score Distribution (MASD) system is to assist novice musicians with playing in an orchestra, concert band, choir or other musical ensemble. MASD helps novice musicians in three ways. It removes the confusion that results from page turns, aides a musician’s return to the proper location in the music score after the looking at the conductor and notifies musicians of conductor instructions. MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system. There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.",

Patchwerk connects to a pre-existing modular synthesizer using the emerging cross-platform HTML5 WebSocket standard to enable low-latency, high-bandwidth, concurrent control of analog signals by multiple users. Online users control physical outputs on a custom-designed cabinet that reflects their activity through a combination of motorized knobs and LEDs, and streams the resultant audio. In a typical installation, a composer creates a complex physical patch on the modular synth that exposes a set of analog and digital parameters (knobs, buttons, toggles, and triggers) to the web-enabled cabinet. Both physically present and online audiences can control those parameters, simultane-ously seeing and hearing the results of each other’s actions. By enabling collaborative interaction with a massive analog synthesizer, Patchwerk brings a broad audience closer to a rare and historically important instrument. Patchwerk is available online at http://synth.media.mit.edu.",

    "abstract": "This paper contends that the development of expressive performance interfaces using multi-touch technology has been hindered by an over-reliance upon GUI paradigms. Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it, approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use –the XY pad and button grid –illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently being used to assess the validity of this approach.",

However, in contrast to the venerable piano-style keyboard, touch screen controllers lack the tactile feedback many performers find crucial. This paper presents an augmentation system for acoustic and electronic keyboards in which multi-touch capacitive sensors are added to the surface of each key. Each key records the position of fingers on the surface, and by combining this data with MIDI note onsets and aftertouch from the host keyboard, the system functions as a multidimensional polyphonic controller for a wide variety of synthesis software. The paper will discuss general capacitive touch sensor design, keyboard-specific implementation strategies, and the development of a flexible mapping engine using OSC and MIDI.",

The motivation behind this work is the need for easy access tools to explore, compose and perform electroacoustic music in Colombian music schools and conservatories. This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record, visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.",

This paper presents a system which analyses a player’s technique using sensor data obtained from an electronic bagpipe chanter interface. Automatic recognition of a broad range of piping embellishments allows real-time visual feedback to be generated, enabling the learner to ensure that they are practicing each movement correctly. The electronic chanter employs a robust and responsive infrared (IR) sensing strategy, and uses audio samples from acoustic recordings to produce a high quality bagpipe sound. Moreover, the continuous nature of the IR sensors offers the controller a considerable degree of flexibility, indicating sig-nificant potential for the inclusion of extended and novel techniques for musical expression in the future.",

    "abstract": "A problem with many contemporary musical robotic percussion systems lies in the fact that solenoids fail to respond lin-early to linear increases in input velocity. This nonlinearity forces performers to individually tailor their compositions to specific robotic drummers. To address this problem, we introduce a method of pre-performance calibration using metaheuristic search techniques. A variety of such techniques are introduced and evaluated and the results of the optimized solenoid-based percussion systems are presented and compared with output from non-calibrated systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents concepts, models, and empirical findings relating to liveness and flow in the user experience of systems mediated by notation. Results from an extensive two-year field study of over 1,000 sequencer and tracker users, combining interaction logging, user surveys, and a video study, are used to illustrate the properties of notations and interfaces that facilitate greater immersion in musical activities and domains, borrowing concepts from programming to illustrate the role of visual and musical feedback, from the notation and domain respectively. The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically-rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software. Users are shown to maintain liveness through a rapid, iterative edit-audition cycle that integrates audio and visual feedback.",

A pair of ex-ample implementations of this strategy are described, one tangible and one graphical. As part of a potentially larger set within our general approach, two separate relationships are described termed ‘decay and contribution’ and ‘instability and adjustment’, which are heavily dependent on the action requirements and timeliness of the interaction. By suggesting this process occurs on a timescale of less than one second it is hoped attentiveness and engagement can be en-couraged to the possible benefit of future developments in digital musical instrument design.",

We present one particular system, FILTER, which was created in the context of a larger project related to artificial intelligence and performance, and has been tested in the context of our electro-acoustic performance trio. We discuss how this timbrally rich and highly non-idiomatic musical context has challenged the design of the system, with particular emphasis on the mapping of machine listening parameters to higher-level behaviors of the system in such a way that spontaneity and creativity are encouraged while maintaining a sense of novel dialogue.",

Acceleration and orientation data derived from internal sensors of an iPod is com-pared to data from a high end optical infrared marker-based motion capture system (Qualisys) in terms of latency, jitter, accuracy and precision.

    "abstract": "Development of new musical interfaces often requires experimentation with the mapping of available controller inputs to output parameters. Useful mappings for a particular application may be complex in nature, with one or more inputs being linked to one or more outputs. Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.",

A new approach creates a personalized on-screen slider that lets the user manipulate the audio in terms of a descriptive term (e.g. \"warm\"), without the user needing to learn or use the interface of an equalizer. This system learns mappings by presenting a sequence of sounds to the user and correlating the gain in each frequency band with the user’s preference rating. The system speeds learning through transfer learning. Results on a study of 35 participants show how an effective, personalized audio manipulation tool can be automatically built after only three ratings from the user.",

Voicon is a non-invasive and gesture-sensitive microphone which allows vocal performers to use natural gestures to create vocal augmentations and modifications by using embedded sensors in a microphone. Through vocal augmentation and modulation, the performers can easily generate desired amount of the vibrato and achieve wider vocal range. These vocal en-hancements will deliberately enrich the vocal performance both in its expressiveness and the dynamics. Using Voicon, singers can generate additional vibrato, control the pitch and activate customizable vocal effect by simple and intuitive gestures in live and recording context.",

The dome, circular speaker and circular seating arrangements provide means for skilled composers and performers to create a virtual reality in which attendees are immersed in the composite instrument. This initial foray into designing an audio-visual computerbased instrument for improvisational performance in a planetarium builds on prior, successful work in mapping the rules and state of two-dimensional computer board games to improvised computer music. The unique visual and audio geometries of the planetarium present challenges and opportunities. The game tessellates the dome in mobile, colored hexagons that emulate both atoms and musical scale intervals in an expanding universe. Spatial activity in the game maps to spatial locale and instrument voices in the speakers, in essence creating a virtual orchestra with a string section, percussion section, etc. on the dome. Future work includes distribution of game play via mobile devices to permit attendees to participate in a performance. This environment is open-ended, with great educational and aesthetic potential.",

The results of the analysis show core-categories such as familiarity with instrument and situation, shift of focus in activity, family of interactions and different categories of the experience emerging from the interviews. Our evaluation shows the suitability of our approach but also the need for iterating on our design on the basis of the perspectives brought forth by the users.

Detection of playing techniques can be used to control exter-nal content (i.e audio loops and effects, videos, light events, etc.), as well as to write real-time score or to assist guitar novices in their learning process. The guitar used is a Godin Multiac with an under-saddle RMC hexaphonic piezo pickup (one pickup per string, i.e six mono signals).",

    "annote": "Designing mobile interfaces for computer-based musical performance is generally a time-consuming task that can be exasperating for performers. Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces’ affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.",

We designed, built and performed with Feedbørk, a two-player instrument comprising two iPads which form a video feedback loop, and Barrel, a nine-player instrument made up of eight Gametrak controllers fastened to a steel industrial barrel. By splitting the control of these instruments into distinct but interdependent roles, we allow each individual to easily play a part while retaining a rich complexity of output for the whole system. We found that the relationships between those roles had a significant effect on how the players communicated with each other, and on how the performance was perceived by the audience.",

We built a prototype based on granular or liquid interaction material placed in a glass dish, that is analyzed by video tracking for its 3D relief. This relief, and the dynamic changes applied to it by the user, are interpreted as activation profiles to drive corpus-based concatenative sound synthesis, allowing one or more players to mold sonic landscapes and to plow through them in an inherently collaborative, expressive, and dynamic experience.",

Four groups of sensors are added: key positions, inertial movement, mouth pressure and trigger switches. The instrument communicates wirelessly with a receiver setup which produces an OSC data stream, usable by any appli-cation on a host computer. The SABRe projects intention is to be neither tied to its inventors nor to one single player but to offer a reference design for a larger community of bass clarinet players and composers. For this purpose, several instruments are made available and a number of composer residencies, workshops, presentations and concerts are organized. These serve for evaluation and improvement purposes in order to build a robust and user friendly extended musical instrument, that opens new playing modalities.",

A wireless microphone has been augmented with six momentary switches, one fader, and three axes of motion and position sensors, all of which provide MIDI output from the wireless receiver. The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor-mal workshops.",

    "abstract": "Corpus-based concatenative synthesis is a fairly recent sound synthesis method, based on descriptor analysis of any number of existing or live-recorded sounds, and synthesis by selection of sound segments from the database matching given sound characteristics. It is well described in the literature, but has been rarely examined for its capacity as a new interface for musical expression. The interesting outcome of such an examination is that the actual instrument is the space of sound characteristics, through which the performer navigates with gestures captured by various input devices. We will take a look at different types of interaction modes and controllers (positional, inertial, audio analysis) and the gestures they afford, and provide a critical assessment of their musical and expressive capabilities, based on several years of musical experience, performing with the CataRT system for real-time CBCS.",

This paradigm attempts to overcome the contrast between the relatively small of amount degrees of freedom usually demonstrated by tangible interfaces and the vast number of possibilities that musical composition presents. SoundStrand is comprised of a set of physical objects called cells, each representing a musical phrase. Cells can be sequentially connected to each other to create a musical theme. Cells can also be physically manipulated to access a wide range of melodic, rhythmic and harmonic variations. The SoundStrand software assures that as the cells are manipulated, the melodic flow, harmonic transitions and rhythmic patterns of the theme remain musically plausible while preserving the user’s intentions.",

Although there are many opportunities to shape the amplitude envelope before loudspeaker amplification, they are all governed by the ever-decaying physical vibra-tions of the tone generating mechanism. A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011. In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat-ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.",

    "abstract": "We describe a system that allows non-programmers to specify the grammar for a novel graphic score notation of their own design, defining performance notations suitable for drawing in live situations on a surface such as a whiteboard. Thescore can be interpreted via the camera of a smartphone,interactively scanned over the whiteboard to control the parameters of synthesisers implemented in Overtone. The visual grammar of the score, and its correspondence to the sound parameters, can be defined by the user with a simple visual condition-action language. This language can be edited on the touchscreen of an Android phone, allowing the grammar to be modified live in performance situations.Interactive scanning of the score is visible to the audience asa performance interface, with a colour classifier and visual feature recogniser causing the grammar-specified events to be sent using OSC messages via Wi-Fi from the hand-held smartphone to an audio workstation.",

Communica-tion with the board is based on the ZigFlea protocol and it has been evaluated on a CUI32 using the StickOS oper-ating system. Experiments show that the total sensor data collection time is linearly increasing with the number of sensor samples used. A data rate of 0.8 kbit/s is achieved for wirelessly transmitting three axes of a 3D accelerometer. Although this data rate is low compared to other systems, our solution benefits from ease-of-use and stability, and is useful for applications that are not time-critical.",

    "abstract": "Hyper-instruments extend traditional acoustic instruments with sensing technologies that capture digitally subtle and sophisticated aspects of human performance. They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.",

The work described in this paper has been motivated by three applications: computer analysis of Gyil performance, live improvised electro-acoustic music incorporating the Gyil, and hybrid sampling and physical mod-eling. In all three of these cases, detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured in real-time. We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a “surrogate” sensor. Some initial results comparing different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.",

Using this mapping layer, we conducted user studies comparing controlling the model muscle activations using a 2D set of force sensors with a position controlled kinematic input space that maps directly to the sound. Preliminary user evaluation suggests that it was more difficult to using force input but the resultant output sound was more intelligible and natural compared to the kinematic controller. This result shows that force input is a potentially feasible for browsing through a vowel space for an articulatory voice synthesis system, although further evaluation is required.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to utilize the expert pianist’s technique and spare bandwidth, a new keyboard-based instrument augmented by sensors suggested by the examination of existing acoustic instruments is introduced. The complete instrument includes a keyboard, various pedals and knee levers, several bowing controllers, and breath and embouchure sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller that sends sensor data to a laptop running Max/MSP, where custom software maps the data to synthesis algorithms. The audio is output to a digital amplifier powering a transducer mounted on a resonator box to which several of the sensors are attached. Careful sensor selection and mapping help to facilitate performance mode.",

    "abstract": "The upper limit of frequency sensitivity for vibrotactile stimulation of the fingers and hand is commonly accepted as 1 kHz. However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.",

This interface provides multi-axial gesture controls to enable continuous adjustments to multiple acoustic parameters such as those on the typical digital synthesizers.

Our system can also be used for other types of gesture interaction as well as for pedagogical applications.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a comprehensive study is performed on the relationship between audio, visual and emotion by applying the principles of cognitive emotion theory into digital creation. The study is driven by an audiovisual emotion library project that is named AVIEM, which provides an interactive interface for experimentation and evaluation of the perception and creation processes of audiovisuals. AVIEM primarily consists of separate audio and visual libraries and grows with user contribution as users explore different combinations between them. The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Simpletones, an interactive sound system that enables a sense of musical collaboration for non-musicians. Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration). Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules \\[1\\]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow\\[2\\]. This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers \\[3\\].",

Players have to listen carefully to the provided auditory clues, like racquet hits and ball bounces, rhythmically synchronizing their movements in order to keep the ball into play. The device can be swung freely and act as a full-fledged motionbased controller, as the game does not rely at all on visual feedback and the device display can thus be ignored. The game aims to be entertaining but also effective for educational purposes, such as ear training or improvement of the sense of timing, and enjoyable both by visually-impaired and sighted users.",

This complexity results in a loss of livenessand possibly a poor experience for the audience. Our approach, called Rouages,is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application.It reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifyingmusicians’ gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representingthe sound components with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing theimpact ofmusicians gestures on these components.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a proof of concept implementation of an interface entitledCoral. The interface serves as a physical and haptic extension of a simulatedcomplex system, which will be employed as an intermediate mechanism for thecreation of generative music and imagery. The paper discusses the motivationand conceptual context that underly the implementation, describes its technicalrealisation and presents some first interaction experiments. The paper focuseson the following two aspects: the interrelation between the physical andvirtual behaviours and properties of the interface and simulation, and thecapability of the interface to enable an intuitive and tangible exploration ofthis hybrid dynamical system.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a graph-theoretic model that supports the design andanalysis of data flow within digital musical instruments (DMIs). The state ofthe art in DMI design fails to provide any standards for the scheduling ofcomputations within a DMI’s data flow. It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI’s performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI’s sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow. We also provide a schedulingalgorithm built upon that framework that guarantees desirable properties forthe resulting DMI.",

To this end, we have developeda reactive environment for distributed performance that provides participantsdynamic, real-time control over several aspects of their performance, enablingthem to change volume levels and experience exaggerated stereo panning. Inaddition, our reactive environment reinforces a feeling of a “shared space”between musicians. It differs most notably from standard ventures into thedesign of novel musical interfaces and installations in its reliance onuser-centric methodologies borrowed from the field of Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI). Not only does this research enable us to closely examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore newinterpretations of the network as a performance space.

    "abstract": "Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.",

In these cases, afront-end processing system for extracting gestural information embedded in thesensor data is essential. In this paper we propose an unsupervised offlinemethod that learns how to reduce and map the gestural data to a genericinstrument parameter control space. We make an unconventional use of theSelf-Organizing Maps to obtain only a geometrical transformation of thegestural data, while dimensionality reduction is handled separately. Weintroduce a novel training procedure to overcome two main Self- Organizing Mapslimitations which otherwise corrupt the interface usability.

This researchinvestigates methods for controlling the level and pitch of the feedbackproduced by a guitar and amplifier, which are based on incorporatingcorpus-based control into the system. Two parameters are used to define thecontrol parameter space – a simple automatic gain control system to controlthe output level, and a band-pass filter frequency for controlling the pitch ofthe feedback. This control parameter space is mapped to a corpus of soundscreated by these parameters and recorded, and these sounds are analysed usingsoftware created for concatenative synthesis.

This system is an extension of areal-time gesture-controlled vowel singing instrument developed in the Max/MSPlanguage. In addition to pitch, vowels and voice strength control, Digitarticis designed for gestural control of articulation parameters for a wide set onconsonant, including various places and manners of articulation. The phases ofarticulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can bedriven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the syntheticphoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmicpatterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. Theinstrument features two (augmented) pen tablets for controlling voiceproduction: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second oneis dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very naturalconsonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms theeffectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument.",

The smart tangibles developed for this interface are able to sense howthey are grasped by the user. The paper presents the design of the mixinginterface including the smart tangible as well as a preliminary user studyinvolving a hands-on focus group session where 5 different control technologiesare contrasted and discussed. Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibleswere preferred, but that an optimal interface would include a combination oftouch, smart tangibles and an extra function control tangible for extending thefunctionality of the smart tangibles. Finally, the interface should incorporateboth an edit and mix mode - the latter displaying very limited visual feedbackin order to force users to focus their attention to listening instead of theinterface.",

    "abstract": "In the design of recent systems, I have advanced techniques that positiongraphic synthesis methods in the context of solo, improvisational performance.Here, the primary interfaces for musical action are prepared works on paper,scanned by digital video cameras which in turn pass image data on to softwarefor analysis and interpretation as sound synthesis and signal processingprocedures. The focus of this paper is on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer’s objective is to guide the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.",

    "abstract": "Several new technologies to capture motion, gesture and forces for musical instrument players’ analyses have been developed in the last years. In research and for augmented instruments one parameter is underrepresented so far. It is finger position and pressure measurement, applied by the musician while playing the musical instrument. In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a musical performance feedback system based on real-time audio-score alignment for musical instrument education of beginner musicians. In the proposed system, we do not make use of symbolic data such as MIDI, but acquire a real-time audio input from on-board microphone of smartphone. Then, the system finds onset and pitch of the note from the signal, to align this information with the ground truth musical score. Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays many music artists rely on visualisations and light shows to enhanceand augment their live performances. However, the visualisation and triggeringof lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely limiting the artist’s freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a minimally-invasive, wireless optical sensorsystem for use with any conventional piston valve acoustic trumpet. Itis designed to be easy to install and remove by any trumpeter. Ourgoal is to offer the extended control afforded by hyperinstrumentswithout the hard to reverse or irreversible invasive modificationsthat are typically used for adding digital sensing capabilities. Weutilize optical sensors to track the continuous position displacementvalues of the three trumpet valves. These values are trasmittedwirelessly and can be used by an external controller. The hardware hasbeen designed to be reconfigurable by having the housing 3D printed sothat the dimensions can be adjusted for any particular trumpetmodel. The result is a low cost, low power, easily replicable sensorsolution that offers any trumpeter the ability to augment their ownexisting trumpet without compromising the instrument’s structure orplaying technique. The extended digital control afforded by our systemis interweaved with the natural playing gestures of an acoustictrumpet. We believe that this seemless integration is critical forenabling effective and musical human computer interaction.Keywords: hyperinstrument, trumpet, minimally-invasive, gesture sensing,wireless, I2C",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative digital musical instrument, the Illusio, based on an augmented multi-touch interface that combines a traditional multi-touch surface and a device similar to a guitar pedal. Illusio allows users to perform by drawing and by associating the sketches with live loops. These loops are manipulated based on a concept called hierarchical live looping, which extends traditional live looping through the use of a musical tree, in which any music operation applied to a given node affects all its children nodes. Finally, we evaluate the instrument considering the performer and the audience, which are two of the most important stakeholders involved in the use, conception, and perception of a musical device. The results achieved are encouraging and led to useful insights about how to improve instrument features, performance and usability.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the mobile music projects that have been presented at NIMEin the past ten years in order to assess whether the changes in technology haveaffected the activities of mobile music research. An overview of mobile musicprojects is presented using the categories that describe the main activities:projects that explore the influence and make use of location; applications thatshare audio or promote collaborative composition; interaction using wearabledevices; the use of mobile phones as performance devices; projects that exploreHCI design issues. The relative activity between different types of activity isassessed in order to identify trends. The classification according totechnological, social or geographic showed an overwhelming bias to thetechnological, followed by social investigations. An alternative classificationof survey product, or artifact reveals an increase in the number of productsdescribed with a corresponding decline in the number of surveys and artisticprojects. The increase in technical papers appears to be due to an enthusiasmto make use of increased capability of mobile phones, although there are signsthat the initial interest has already peaked, and researchers are againinterested to explore technologies and artistic expression beyond existingmobile phones.",

It is hopedthat the techniques described in this paper afford performers and composers anenhanced level of creative expression in the diffusion performance practice.This paper introduces and evaluates tactile.space, a multi-touch performanceinterface for diffusion built on the BrickTable. It describes how tactile.spaceimplements Vector Base Amplitude Panning to achieve real- time sourcepositioning. The final section of this paper presents the findings of a userstudy that was conducted by those who performed with the interface, evaluatingthe interface as a performance tool with a focus on the increased creativeexpression the interface affords, and directly comparing it to the traditionaldiffusion user interface.",

The aim is to provide a rich environment for works whichblur the boundaries between dance and instrumental performance – and sound andvisuals – while maintaining transparency for audiences and new performers. The system uses infra-red motion tracking to allow performers to manipulate areal-time fluid simulation, which in turn provides control data forcomputer-generated audio and visuals. It also provides a control andconfiguration system which allows the behaviour of the interactive system to bechanged over time, enabling the structure within which interactions take placeto be ‘composed’.",

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a design of alearning environment for a novice learner to acquire an accurate fingerposition skill. For achieving the aim, we developed a learning environmentwhich can diagnose learner’s finger position and give the learner advice byusing magnetic position sensors. The system shows three windows; a fingerposition window for visualization of finger position, a score window fordiagnosing finger position along the score and command prompt window forshowing states of system and advices. Finally, we evaluated the system by anexperiment. The experimental group improved accuracy values about fingerpositions and also improved accuracy of pitches of sounds compared withcontrol group. These results shows significant differences.",

A music performance can be described with compositionaland expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we oftenobserve particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a\"\"gesture\"\", since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuminga finite number of latent states on each property value changes, we candescribe those gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train themby unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us ameasure for different effects of each properties on the gesture implementation.Test result on some of real performances indicates that the trained modelscould capture the structure of gestures observed in the given performances, anddetect their boundaries.

In some courses they are typically gettingin touch online with each others for doing some particular group workassignments, but most of the time they must do their own learning tasks alone.In other courses simply the individual assignments and quizzes are provided, sothe learners are alone all the time from the beginning until the end of thecourse.In order to keep the learners’ motivation, it helps to feel other learnersdoing the same learning activities and belonging to the same course.Communicating formally or informally with other learners via Social NetworkingServices or something is one way for learners to get such a feeling, though ina way it might sometimes disturb their learning. Sonification of the access logof the e-learning system could be another indirect way to provide such afeeling.",

People usually learn beatboxing in the traditional way of imitatingaudio sample without steps and instructions. Spectrogram contains a lot ofinformation about audio, but it is too complicated to be understood inreal-time. Reinforcement learning is a psychological method, which makes use ofreward and/or punishment as stimulus to train the decision-making process ofhuman. We propose a novel music learning approach based on the reinforcementlearning method, which makes use of compact and easy-to-read spectruminformation as visual clue to assist human beatboxing learning on smartphone.Experimental result shows that the visual information is easy to understand inreal-time, which improves the effectiveness of beatboxing self-learning.",

Software extracts traditional and novel features of keyboard touch fromeach note, which can be flexibly mapped to sound using MIDI or Open SoundControl.

    "abstract": "We present an interactive content-based MIR environment specifically designedto aid in the exploration of databases of experimental electronic music,particularly in cases where little or no metadata exist. In recent years,several rare archives of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata - some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher’sunderstanding of the data.",

The Novint Falcon force feedback interfaceis used to scan through soundfiles as a subject moves their hand horizontallyfrom left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness, or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject’s hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for‘pre-feeling’ as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.",

In addition, it has a wireless communication function thatsynchronizes musical scale and BPM between multiple devices. To date, various kinds of “inventive” electronic musical instruments havebeen created in the field of Computer Music field. The authors are interestedin formations of musical sessions, aiming for a balance between simpleinteraction and musical expression. This study focuses on the development ofperformance playing styles.Musicians occasionally change their playing styles (e.g., guitar pluckingstyle) during a musical session. Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces. The authors expected thatchanging interfaces would bring similar effect as changing playing style by theskillful player. This research aims to establish an environment in whichnonmusicians and musicians share their individual musical ideas easily. Here,the interaction design and configuration of the “POWDER BOX” is presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the Musical Poi (mPoi), a unique sensor-based musicalinstrument rooted in the ancient art of poi spinning. The trajectory ofcircular motion drawn by the performance and the momentum of the mPoiinstrument are converted to the energetic and vibrant sound, which makesspiritual and meditative soundscape that opens everyone up the aura and clearsthe thought forms away. The mPoi project and its concepts will be introducedfirst and then its interaction with a performer will be discussed.The mPoi project seeks to develop a prototype for a set of mobile musicalinstrument based on electronic motion sensors and circuit boards. Thistechnology is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance, which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music. The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software, which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate theperformer’s gesture into sound. A unique algorithm was developed to extractfeatures of the swing motion and translate them into various patterns of sound.",

    "abstract": "The Internet allows musicians and other artists to collaborate remotely.However, network latency presents a fundamental challenge for remotecollaborators who need to coordinate and respond to each other’s performancein real time. In this paper, we investigate the viability of predictingpercussion hits before they have occurred, so that information about thepredicted drum hit can be sent over a network, and the sound can be synthesizedat a receiver’s location at approximately the same moment the hit occurs atthe sender’s location. Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.",

Near-field optical sensors are inexpensive,portable and non-intrusive, and their high spatial and temporal resolutionmakes them ideal for tracking the finer motions of instrumental performance.The paper discusses general optical sensor performance with detailedinvestigations of three sensor models. An application is presented to violinbow position tracking using reflective sensors mounted on the stick. Bowtracking remains a difficult task, and many existing solutions are expensive,bulky, or offer limited temporal resolution. Initial results indicate that bowposition and pressure can be derived from optical measurements of thehair-string distance, and that similar techniques may be used to measure bowtilt.",

Such movement empowers an expressive dynamic for bothperformer and audience. However tracking movements in free space isnotoriously difficult for virtuosic performance. The lack of tactile feedbackleads to difficulty learning the repeated muscle movements required for precisecontrol. In comparison, the hands have shown an impressive ability to mastercomplex motor tasks through feel. The hand controller uses both modes ofinteraction. Electro-magnetic field tracking enables 6D hand motion trackingwhile two options provide tactile interaction- a set of tracks that providelinear positioning and applied finger pressure, or a set of trumpet like sliderkeys that provide continuous data describing key depth.

    "abstract": "\"Since Euler’s development of the Tonnetz in 1739, musicians, composers andinstrument designers have been fascinated with the concept of musicalisomorphism, the idea that by arranging tones by their harmonic relationshipsrather than by their physical properties, the common shapes of musicalconstructs will appear, facilitating learning and new ways of exploringharmonic spaces. The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limitedsquare isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challengein the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging noteactuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrumentdesign. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphismcan be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (aswell as composer and performer) to \"\"lock in\"\" to a single isomorphism, or tohave a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix(an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musicalinstruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphicinstruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide varietyof different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages ofeach. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embeddedwith RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphismcurrently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments /experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments.\"",

Usually, pitch is set at thecontact point on the interface, thus introducing possible pitch inaccuracies atthe note onset. This paper proposes a new algorithm, based on an adaptiveattraction mapping, for improving initial pitch accuracy with touch userinterfaces with continuous control. At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point. Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained, allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results of experimentscomparing the users’ pitch accuracy with and without the help of the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player. Therefore, thedynamic mapping algorithm allows for a clean and accurate attack when playing touch user interfaces for controlling continuous pitch instruments like voicesynthesizers.",

    "abstract": "Web technologies provide an incredible opportunity to present new musicalinterfaces to new audiences. Applications written in JavaScript and designed torun in the browser offer remarkable performance, mobile/desktop portability andlongevity due to standardization. Our research examines the use and potentialof native web technologies for musical expression. We introduce two librariestowards this end: Gibberish.js, a heavily optimized audio DSP library, andInterface.js, a GUI toolkit that works with mouse, touch and motion events.Together these libraries provide a complete system for defining musicalinstruments that can be used in both desktop and mobile browsers. Interface.jsalso enables control of remote synthesis applications by including anapplication that translates the socket protocol used by browsers into both MIDIand OSC messages.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the musical interactions aspects of the design anddevelopment of a web-based interactive music collaboration system called JamOn. Following a design science approach, this system is being built accordingto principles taken from usability engineering and human computer interaction(HCI). The goal of the system is to allow people with no to little musicalbackground to play a song collaboratively. The musicians control the musicalcontent and structure of the song thanks to an interface relying on the freeinking metaphor. One contribution of this interface is that it displays musicalpatterns of different lengths in the same space. The design of Jam On is basedon a list of performance criteria aimed at ensuring the musicality of theperformance and the interactivity of the technical system. The paper comparestwo alternative interfaces used for the system and explores the various stagesof the design process aimed at making the system as musical and interactive aspossible.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present some custom designed filters for real-time motioncapture applications. Our target application is so-called motion controllers,i.e. systems that interpret hand motion for musical interaction. In earlierresearch we found effective methods to design nearly optimal filters forreal-time applications. However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency contentof the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in ourexperience are the most useful filters for our target application.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel collaborative environment (PESI) in whichperformers are not only free to move and interact with each other but wheretheir social interactions contribute to the sonic outcome. PESI system isdesigned for co-located collaboration and provides embodied and spatialopportunities for musical exploration. To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians’ comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the ’in-space’ response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the ’on-body’ mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers. We plan to implement thisversion and evaluate design and implementation with distinct skilled musicians.",

    "abstract": "In guitar performance, fingering is an important factor, and complicated. In particular, the fingering of the left hand comprises various relationshipsbetween the finger and the string, such as a finger touching the strings, afinger pressing the strings, and a finger releasing the strings. The recognition of the precise fingering of the left hand is applied to aself-learning support system, which is able to detect strings being muted by afinger, and which transcribes music automatically, including the details offingering techniques. Therefore, the goal of our study is the construction of a system forrecognizing the touch of strings for the guitar. We propose a method for recognizing the touch of strings based on theconductive characteristics of strings and frets. We develop a prototype system, and evaluate its effectiveness.Furthermore, we propose an application which utilizes our system.",

In this work we demonstrate a prototype,the Enactive Mandala, which maps real-time EEG signals to modulate ambientmusic and animated visual music. The design draws inspiration from the visualmusic of the Whitney brothers as well as traditional meditative practices.Transparent real-time audio-visual feedback ofbrainwave qualities supports intuitive insight into the connection betweenthoughts and physiological states. Our method is constructive: by linkingphysiology with an dynamic a/v display, and embedding the human-machine systemin the social contexts that arise in real-time play, we hope to seed new, andas yet unknown forms, of non-verbal communication, or “artificialexpressions”.",

In this paper, we present anovel multi-touch interface method aimed at professional keyboard players. Themethod, which is inspired by computer trackpads, allows controlling up to tencontinuous parameters of a keyboard with one hand, without requiring the userto look at the touch area - a significant improvement over traditional keyboardinput controls. We discuss optimizations needed to make our interface reliable,and show in an evaluation with four keyboarders of different skill level thatthis method is both intuitive and powerful, and allows users to more quicklyalter the sound of their keyboard than they could with current input solutions.",

Artists and sound designers who are interested in accessing that data to make music must currently possess low-level knowledge of Internet protocols and spend signifi-cant effort working with low-level networking code. We have created SonNet, a new software tool that lowers these practical barriers to experimenting and composing with network data. SonNet executes packet-sniffng and network connection state analysis automatically, and it includes an easy-touse ChucK object that can be instantiated, customized, and queried from a user’s own code. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the SonNet system, and we discuss a pilot evaluation of the system with computer music composers. We also discuss compositional applications of SonNet and illustrate the use of the system in an example composition.",

    "abstract": "We use Max/MSP framework to create a reliable but flexible approach for managing live performances of music bands who rely on live playing with digital music. This approach utilizes Max/MSP to allow any player an easy and low cost way to apply and experiment innovative music interfaces for live performance, without losing the professionalism required on stage. In that approach, every 1-3 players is plugged to a unit consisting of a standard sound-card and laptop. This unit is controlled by an interface that schedules and manages all the digital sounds made by each player (VST effects, VST instruments and ’home-made’ interactive interfaces). All the player’s units are then remotely controlled by a conductor patch which is in charge of the synchronization of all the players and background samples in real time, as well as providing sensitive metronome and scheduling visual enhancement. Moreover, and not less important, we can take the advantage of using virtual instruments and virtual effects in Max environment to manage the mix, and routing the audio. This providing monitors and metronome to the players ears, and virtual mixing via Max/MSP patch. This privilege almost eliminates the dependency in the venue’s equipment, and in that way, the sound quality and music ideas can be taken out directly from the studio to the stage.",

We describe the composition process from how we decompose a linear beat-based and vocal sound material; recompose it with real-time audio synthesis and composition rules into interactive Scenes. Scenes that make it possible for the user to select, explore and recreate different “sound worlds\" with the tangible interface as an instrument; create and play with it as a friend; improvise and create; or relax with it as an ambient sounding furniture. We continue discussing a user story, how the Scenes are recreated by amateur users, persons with severe disabilities and family members; improvising with the mobile tangibles. We discuss composition techniques for mixing sound, tangible-physical and lighting elements in the Scenes. Based on observations we explore how a diverse audience in the family and at school can recreate and improvise their own sound experience and play together with others. We conclude by discussing the possible impact of our findings for the NIME-community; how the techniques of decomposing, recomposing and recreating sound, based on a relational perspective, could contribute to the design of new instruments for musical expression.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new circular tangible interface where one or multiple users can collaborate and interact in real time by placing and moving passive wooden pucks on a transparent tabletop in order to create music. The design encourages physical intuition and visual feedback on the music being created. An arm with six optical sensors rotates beneath a transparent surface, triggering sounds based on the objects placed above. The interface’s simplicity and tangibility make it easy to learn and suitable for a broad range of users.",

It implements a novel interface concept for modulating noise spectra. Each particle represents a sine oscillator that moves through the two-dimensional frequency and stereo panning domain via Brownian motion. Its behavior can be affected by multitouch gestures allowing the shaping of the resulting sound in many different ways. Particles can be dragged, attracted, repelled, accentuated, and their autonomous behavior can be manipulated. In this paper we introduce the concepts behind this instrument, describe its implementation and discuss the sonic design space emerging from it.",

We ground our concept as an extension of work by David Tudor, Nicolas Collins and Bowers and Archer \\[NIME 2005\\] and draw on a variety of critical perspectives in the social sciences and philosophy to explore such assemblages as an alternative to more familiar ideas of instruments and interfaces. We lay out a conceptual framework for the exploration of hybrid resonant assemblages and describe how we have approached implementing them. Our performance experience is presented and implications for work are discussed. In the light of our work, we urge a reconsideration of the implicit norms of performance which underlie much research in NIME. In particular, drawing on the philosophical work of Jean-Luc Nancy, we commend a wider notion of touch that also recognises the performative value of withholding contact.",

Drawing on a critical literature in studies of material culture, the work incorporated data sonification, image audification, field recordings and created a number of instruments for exploring geological artefacts and meterological data as aesthetic material. The residency culminated in an exhibition presented as a ’sensorium’ for the sensory exploration of museum objects. In describing the methods and thinking behind the project this paper presents an alternative approach to engaging artists and audiences with local heritage and museum archives, which draws on research in NIME and allied literatures, and which is devoted to enlivening collections as occasions for varied interpretation, appropriation and aesthetic response.",

    "abstract": "Audiences of live laptop music frequently express dismay at the opacity of performer activity and question how “live\" performances actually are. Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners’ perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.",

We discuss experiences individuals tend to have with music as consumers and performers and explore how these experiences can be modified, aided, or improved by the inherent synergies between a human and robot. An overview of several applications developed for Shimi is provided. These applications place Shimi in various roles and enable human-robotic interactions (HRIs) that are highlighted by more personable social communications using natural language and other forms of communication.",

However, if a user has a general idea of the sound they are trying to program, they may be able to imitate it with their voice. This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feedback. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing “factory presets\" or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.",

By connecting air hoses to spinning disks with evenly-spaced perforations, the siren timbre is translated musically. Polyphony gives our instrument an organ-like personality: keys are mapped to different frequencies and the pressure applied to them determines volume. The siren organ can produce a large range of sounds both timbrally and dynamically. In addition to a siren timbre, the instrument produces similar sounds to a harmonica. Portability, robustness, and electronic stability are all areas for improvement.",

This paper seeks to illuminate some of the historical precedents to the scene, its primary aesthetic goals, and the divergent technological and musical approaches of representative participants. We keep in mind the novel possibilities in musical expression explored by algoravers. The scene is by no means homogeneous, and the very lack of uniformity of technique, from new live coding languages through code DJing to plug-in combination, with or without visual extension, is indicative of the flexibility of computers themselves as general information processors.",

    "abstract": "According to the tradition, music ensembles are usually lead by a conductor who is the responsible to coordinate and guide the group under a specific musical criteria. Similarly, computer ensembles resort to a conductor to keep the synchronization and structural coordination of the performance, often with the assistance of software. Achieving integration and coherence in a networked performance, however, can be challenging in certain scenarios. This is the case for configurations with a high degree of mutual interdependence and shared control. This paper focuses on the design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective instruments. We propose a novel conductor dimension space representation for collective instruments, which takes into account both its social and structural features. We present a case study of a collective instrument implementing a software conductor. Finally, we discuss the implications of human and machine conduction schemes in the context of the proposed dimension space.",

    "abstract": "Motion sensing technologies enable musical interfaces where a performer moves their body \"in the air\" without manipulating or contacting a physical object. These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform “air-drumming\" gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.",

    "abstract": "Two related versions of an unstable live algorithm for the Disklavier player piano are presented. The underlying generative feedback system consists of four virtual musicians, listening to each other in a circular configuration. There is no temporal form, and all parameters of the system are controlled by the performer through an intricate but direct mapping, in an attempt to combine the experienced musician’s physical control of gesture and phrasing, with the structural complexities and richness of generative music. In the first version, Circle Squared, the interface is an array of pressure sensors, and the performer performs on the system without participating directly, like a puppet master. In the second version, control parameters are derived directly from playing on the same piano that performs the output of the system. Here, the performer both plays with and on the system in an intricate dance with the unpredictable output of the unstable virtual ensemble. The underlying mapping strategies are presented, together with the structure of the generative system. Experiences from a series of performances are discussed, primarily from the perspective of the improvising musician.",

    "abstract": "The idea behind the YouHero was two-fold. First, to make an expressive instrument out of the computer game toy guitar controller from the famous game GuitarHero. With its limited amount of control parameters, this was a challenge. Second, through this instrument we wanted to provide an alternative to the view that you become a hero by perfect imitation of your idols. Instead, play yourself. You are the hero. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, including its novel mapping approach based on switched timbre vectors scaled by accellerometer data, unconventional sound engines and the sound and mapping editing features, including manual editing of individual vectors. The instrument is evaluated through its practical applications during the whole project, with workshops with teenagers, a set of state-funded commissions from professional composers, and the development of considerable skill by the key performers. We have also submitted a performance proposal for this project.",

Improvasher is built around two music processing modules, the first, a performance following technique, makes beat-synchronous predictions of chroma features from a live musical input. The second, a music mashup system, determines the compatibility between beat-synchronous chromagrams from different pieces of music. Through the combination of these two techniques, a real-time time predict mashup can be generated towards a new form of automatic accompaniment for interactive musical performance.",

Trying to extend this meaningful activity, which can be highly enjoyable, to a larger recipient group, we present WIJAM, a mobile application for an ad-hoc group of musical novices to perform improvisation along with a music master. In this “master-players\" paradigm, the master offers a music backing, orchestrates the musical flow, and gives feedbacks to the players; the players improvise by tapping and sketching on their smartphones. We believe that this paradigm can be a significant contribution to the possibility of music playing by a group of novices with no instrumental training leading to decent musical results.",

    "abstract": "Sketching is a natural way for one person to convey their thoughts and intentions to another. With the recent rise of tablet-based computing, the use of sketching as a control and interaction paradigm is one that deserves exploration. In this paper we present an interactive sketch-based music composition and performance system called Drawchestra. The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once recognised, these virtual instruments can then be played by the user in real time. The size of a sketched instrument shape is used to control certain parameters of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras containing many different shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the next steps for the system design.",

The controller combines an Arduino microcontroller with a grid of photoresistors set into a slab of wood covered with a thin acrylic sheet. A brief background on past uses of these components for music and film composition and instrument-building introduces a few different implementations and performance contexts for the controller. Topics such as implementation, construction, and performance possibilities (including electroacoustic and audio-visual performance) of the controller are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "We present the FingerSynth, a wearable musical instrument made up of a bracelet and set of rings that enable its player to produce sound by touching nearly any surface in their environment. Each ring contains a small, independently controlled exciter transducer commonly used for auditory bone conduction. The rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise. When a wearer touches their own (or someone else’s) head, the contacted person hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery. The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making music with everything they touch.",

    "abstract": "The Space Between Us is a live performance piece for vocals, piano and live electronics using a Brain-Computer Music Interface system for emotional control of the score. The system not only aims to reflect emotional states but to direct and induce emotional states through the real-time generation of the score, highlighting the potential of direct neural-emotional manipulation in live performance. The EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features within the EEG. We measure the two emotional descriptors, valence and arousal, within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively, whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals’ emotional states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the two responses together. This work highlights the potential available in affecting neural-emotional manipulation within live performance and demonstrates a new approach to real-time, affectively-driven composition.",

    "abstract": "In the paper I present a robotic device that offers new ways of interaction for producing rhythmic patterns. The apparatus is placed on an overhead projector and a visual presentation of these rhythmic patterns is delivered as a shadow play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of the robot, through direct physical interaction with the robot, by rewiring the internal connectivity, and by adjusting internal parameters. The theory of embodied cognition provides the theoretical basis of this device. The core postulate of embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism’s nervous system, the organism’s body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas and it is effectively possible to play with it at all the three levels, the electronics, the physical configuration of the robot and the environment.",

The authors argue that dementia technology has yet to focus on collaborative multi-user group musical interactions. The project aims to contribute to dementia care while addressing a significant gap in current literature. Two trials explore contrasting musical scenarios: the performance of abstract electronic music and the distributed performance of J.S. Bach’s Goldberg Variations. Findings presented in this paper; demonstrate that people with dementia can successfully perform and engage in collaborative music performance activities with little or no scaffolded instruction. Further findings suggest that people with dementia can develop and retain musical performance skill over time. This paper proposes a number of guidelines and design solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this demonstration, the mapping and the gestural control strategy developed in the Digitartic are presented. Digitartic is a musical instrument able to control sung syllables. Performative rule-based synthesis allows for controlling semi-consonants, plosive, fricative and nasal consonants with a same gesture, despite the structural differences in natural production of such vocal segments. A graphic pen tablet is used for capturing the gesture with a high sampling rate and resolution. This system alows for both performing various manners of articulation and having a continuous control over the articulation.",

We focus on a mapping–by–demonstration approach in which the relationships between motion and sound are defined by a machine learning model that learns from a set of user examples.

    "abstract": "The modern musician enjoys access to a staggering number of audio samples. Composition software can ship with many gigabytes of data, and there are many more to be found online. However, conventional methods for navigating these libraries are still quite rudimentary, and often involve scrolling through alphabetical lists. We present a system for sample exploration that allows audio clips to be sorted according to user taste, and arranged in any desired 2D formation such that similar samples are located near each other. Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.",

    "abstract": "CollideFx is a real-time audio effects processor that integrates the physics of real objects into the parameter space of the signal chain. Much like a traditional signal chain, the user can choose a series of effects and offer realtime control to their various parameters. In this work, we introduce a means of creating tree-like signal graphs that dynamically change their routing in response to changes in the location of the unit generators in a virtual space. Signals are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do the decision making.",

    "abstract": "We present an instrument for audio-visual performance that allows to recombine sounds from a collection of sampled media through concatenative synthesis. A three-dimensional distribution derived from feature-analysis becomes accessible through a theremin-inspired interface, allowing the player to shift from exploration and intuitive navigation toward embodied performance on a granular level. In our example we illustrate this concept by using the audiovisual recording of an instrumental performance as a source. Our system provides an alternative interface to the musical instrument’s audiovisual corpus: as the instrument’s sound and behavior is accessed in ways that are not possible on the instrument itself, the resulting non-linear playback of the grains generates an instant remix in a cut-up aesthetic. The presented instrument is a human-computer interface that employs the structural outcome of machine analysis accessing audiovisual corpora in the context of a musical performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings, design, and development of a hyper–instrumental performance system driven by gestural data obtained from an electric guitar. The system combines a multichannel audio feed from the guitar (which is parsed for its pitch, spectral content and note inter–onset time data to provide abstractions of sounded performance gestures) with motion tracking of the performer’s larger–scale bodily movements using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor. These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied structural relationships in electroacoustic music outlined in Smalley’s theory of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds to control the spatialization of outputs and other textural processes. The paper aims to advance a broadly-applicable ’performance gesture ecology’, providing a shared spatial-relational mapping (a ’basic gestural space’) which allows for creative (but still coherent) mappings from the performance gestures to the control of textural and spatial structures.",

Drawing on the work of Born, I sketch an outline of the reach of these topics. I suggest that practice-led methods, by dint of focussing on the lived experience where many of these topics converge, may be able to serve as a useful methodological ‘glue’ for NIME by helping stimulate useful agonistic discussion on our objects of study, and map the untidy contours of contemporary practices. I contextualise this discussion by presenting two recently developed improvisation systems and drawing from these some starting suggestions for how attention to the grain of lived practice could usefully contribute to considerations for designers in terms of the pursuit of musicality and the care required in considering performances in evaluation.",

It represents multiple audio device prototypes, which encourage new chances for street artists and activists to contribute their messages and signs in public spaces.

In line with the methodological principles of practice as research, we describe the development and design of one such instrument-Stringtrees. The design process also reflects the notion of ambiguity as a resource in design: The instrument was endowed with a collection of sensors, controls, and actuators without a highly specific or prescriptive model for how a musician would interact with it.",

However, those platforms typically target everyday programmers rather than composers and media artists. On the other hand, tangible user interface (TUI) toolkits, which provide an integrated, easy-to-use solution have not gained momentum in modern music creation. We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of \"universal pins,\" which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "What do new possibilities for music and art making look like in a world in which the biological and mechanical are increasingly entangled? Can a contrived environment envelope the senses to the point that one feel fully immersed in it? It was with these questions in mind that the interactive mechanical sound art installation endo/exo came into being. Through the use of networked technology the system becomes more like a self-aware organism, passing messages from node to node as cells communicate through chemical signals with their neighbors. In an artistic context, the communication network resembles, but differs from, other mechanical systems. Issues such as latency are often considered negative factors, yet they can contribute a touch of personality in this context. This paper is a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization, as well as playful interaction, creates an “aliveness\" in the mechanism, and renders its exploration pleasurable, intriguing and uncanny.",

Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical notes. Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.",

    "abstract": "Moving new DMIs from the research lab to professional artistic contexts places new demands on both their design and manufacturing. Through a discussion of the Prosthetic Instruments, a family of digital musical instruments we designed for use in an interactive dance performance, we discuss four different approaches to manufacturing -artisanal, building block, rapid prototyping, and industrial. We discuss our use of these different approaches as we strove to reconcile the many conflicting constraints placed upon the instruments’ design due to their use as hypothetical prosthetic extensions to dancers’ bodies, as aesthetic objects, and as instruments used in a professional touring context. Experiences and lessons learned during the design and manufacturing process are discussed in relation both to these manufacturing approaches as well as to Bill Buxton’s concept of artist-spec design.",

    "abstract": "Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences. Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover, soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music that directly respond to people’s movements through space. In light of these trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process from a composer’s perspective by presenting ‘from the field’ an account of how they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public sculpture park. We chart a composer’s rationale as they developed a soundtrack for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre, rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that we intend to guide future practice and research.",

    "abstract": "Although an analog technology, many DJs still value the turntable as an irreplaceable performance tool. Digital vinyl systems combine the distinct haptic nature of the analog turntable with the advantages of digital media. They use special records containing a digital timecode which is then processed by a computer and mapped to properties like playback speed and direction. These records, however, are generic and, in contrast to traditional vinyl, do not provide visual cues representing the structure of the track. We present a system that augments the timecode record with a visualization of song information such as artist, title, and track length, but also with a waveform that allows to visually navigate to a certain beat. We conducted a survey examining the acceptance of such tools in the DJ community and conducted a user study with professional DJs. The system was widely accepted as a tool in the DJ community and received very positive feedback during observational mixing sessions with four professional DJs.",

    "abstract": "One problem with live computer music performance is the transport of computers to a venue and the following setup of the computers used in playing and rendering music. The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there’s a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new technique for creating Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing with open source technology for use in creating richer and more complex musical gestures. This new style of capacitive touch sensing is extremely robust compared to older versions and will allow greater implementation of gesture recognition and touch control in the development of NIMEs. Inspired by the Touché project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing. Furthermore, this paper will introduce a new Arduino Library, SweepingCapSense, which simplifies the coding required to implement this technique.",

    "abstract": "Although new sensor devices and data streams are increasingly used for musical expression, and although eye-tracking devices have become increasingly cost-effective and prevalent in research and as a means of communication for people with severe motor impairments, eye-controlled musical expression nonetheless remains somewhat elusive and minimally explored. This paper (a) identifies a number of fundamental human eye movement capabilities and constraints which determine in part what can and cannot be musically expressed with eye movements, (b) reviews prior work on eye-controlled musical expression, and (c) analyzes and provides a taxonomy of what has been done, and what will need to be addressed in future eye-controlled musical instruments. The fundamental human constraints and processes that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes. The control of the musical instrument is less direct than if it were played with muscles that can be controlled in a more direct manner, such as the muscles in the hands.",

    "abstract": "The Well–Sequenced Synthesizer is a series of sequencers that create music in dialog with the user. Through the sequencers’ physical interfaces, users can control music theory-based generative algorithms. This series –a work-in-progress-is composed by three sequencers at this time. The first one, called The Counterpointer, takes a melody input from the user and responds by generating voices based on the rules of eighteenth–century counterpoint. The second one is based on a recent treatise on harmony and counterpoint by music theorist Dmitri Tymoczco: El Ordenador lets users explore a set of features of tonality by constraining randomly generated music according to one or more of them. El Ordenador gives the user less control than The Counterpointer, but more than La Mecánica, the third sequencer in the series. La Mecánica plays back the sequences generated by El Ordenador using a punch-card reading music box mechanism. It makes the digital patterns visible and tactile, and links them back to the physical world.",

In this paper we challenge this phenomenon and aim for a new bond between the audience and the DJ through the creation of an interactive dance concept: Experio. Experio allows for multiple audience participants influencing the musical performance through dance, facilitated by a musical moderator using a tailored interface. This co-creation of electronic music on both novice and expert levels is a new participatory live performance approach, which is evaluated on the basis of thousands of visitors who interacted with Experio during several international exhibitions.",

    "abstract": "Government spying on internet traffic has seemingly become ubiquitous. Not to be left out, the private sector tracks our online footprint via our ISP or with a little help from facebook. Web services, such as advertisement servers and Google track our progress as we surf the net and click on links. The Mozilla plugin, Lightbeam (formerly Collusion), shows the user a visual map of every site a surfer sends data to. A interconnected web of advertisers and other (otherwise) invisible data-gatherers quickly builds during normal usage. We propose modifying this plugin so that as the graph builds, its state is broadcast visa OSC. Members of BiLE will receive and interpret those OSC messages in SuperCollider and PD. We will act as a translational object in a process of live-sonification. The collected data is the material with which we will develop a set of music tracks based on patterns we may discover. The findings of our data collection and the developed music will be presented in the form of an audiovisual live performance. Snippets of collected text and URLs will both form the basis of our audio interpretation, but also be projected on to a screen, so an audience can voyeuristically experience the actions taken on their behalf by governments and advertisers. After the concert, all of the scripts and documentation related to the data collection and sharing in the piece will be posted to github under a GPL license.",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for imitation of percussion performances with parameter-based learning for accurate reproduction. We constructed a robotic setup involving pull-solenoids attached to drum sticks which communicate with a computer through an Arduino microcontroller. The imitation framework allows for parameter adaptation to different mechanical constructions by learning the capabilities of the overall system being used. For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken, our setup will then listen to a human drummer’s performance pattern, analyze for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations of our constructed system.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an enhanced sonic data communication method using TAPIR (Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range: frequencies above 18kHz) sound and a software toolkit as its implementation. Using inaudible sound as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional hardware. “TAPIR Sound Tag\" is a smart device framework for inaudible data communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of 200 bps can be achieved, enabling peer-to-peer or broadcasting real-time data communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication. Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative completion of an artist’s work by audience. We expect this framework to provide a new way of audience interaction to artists, as well as further promoting audience participation by simplifying the process: using personal smart devices as a medium and not requiring additional hardware or complex settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces recent developments in the Chronus series, a family of custom controllers that afford a performer gestural interaction with surround sound systems that can be easily integrated into their personal performance systems. The controllers are built with the goal of encouraging more electronic musicians to include the creation of dynamic pantophonic fields in performance. The paper focuses on technical advances of the Chronus 2.0 prototype that extend the interface to control both radial and angular positional data, and the controllers’ ease of integration into electronic performance configurations, both for diffusion and for performance from the wider electronic music community.",

    "abstract": "The maturation process of the NIME field has brought a growing interest in teaching the design and implementation of Digital Music Instruments (DMI) as well as in finding objective evaluation methods to assess the suitability of these outcomes. In this paper we propose a methodology for teaching NIME design and a set of tools meant to inform the design process. This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME creation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance aspects of each project, according to Listeners’ impressions after each performance. Listeners’ previous music knowledge was also considered. Through this methodology, students with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of informing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.",

The classic puzzle game, for one person, is extended by mapping the moves of the game through a self contained system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, triggering both analogue and digital sound. The solitaire board, as instrument, is presented as a wood and Perspex box with the hardware inside. Ball bearings function as both solitaire pegs and switches, while a purpose built solenoid controlled monochord and ball bearing run provide the analogue sound source, which is digitally manipulated in real-time, according to the sequences of game moves. The creative intention of Sounds of Solitaire is that the playful approach to participation in a musical experience, provided by the material for music making in real-time, demonstrates an integrated approach to concepts of composing, performing and listening.",

    "abstract": "Echo State Networks (ESNs), a form of recurrent neural network developed in the field of Reservoir Computing, show significant potential for use as a tool in the design of mappings for digital musical instruments. They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. <i>Un-trained</i> behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.",

The measurements are coordinated over an IP network in a decentralized manner, while the actual measurements are carried out measuring the time-of-flight of the notes played by different devices. Approaches to sonify the discovery process are discussed. A specific instantiation of the system is described in detail. The melody is specified in the form of a score, available to every device in the network. The system performs the melody by playing different notes consecutively on different devices, keeping a consistent timing, while carrying out the inter-device measurements necessary to discover the geometrical configuration of the devices in the physical space.",

For the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software, whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger scale project investigating the effect of social structures on the musical output of laptop ensembles.",

    "abstract": "People with a physical handicap are often not able to engage and embrace the world of music on the same terms as normal functioning people. Musical instruments have been refined the last centuries which makes them highly specialized instruments that nearly all requires at least two functioning hands. In this study we try to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar. We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their 2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed that children with hemiplegia were able to play the actuated guitar by producing rhythmical movement across the strings that enables them to enter a world of music they so often see as closed.",

    "abstract": "In the setting of collaborative live coding, a number of issues emerge: (1) need for communication, (2) issues of conflicts in sharing program state space, and (3) remote control of code execution. In this paper, we propose solutions to these problems. In the recent extension of UrMus, a programming environment for mobile music application development, we introduce a paradigm of shared and individual namespaces safeguard against conflicts in parallel coding activities. We also develop live variable view that communicates live changes in state among live coders, networked performers, and the audience. Lastly, we integrate collaborative aspects of programming execution into built-in live chat, which enables not only communication with others, but also distributed execution of code.",

    "abstract": "Pop music jamming on the keyboard requires massive music knowledge. Musician needs to understand and memorize the behavior of each chord in different keys. However, most simple pop music follows a common chord progression pattern. This pattern applies to most simple pop music on all the 12 keys. We designed an app that can reduce the difficulty of music jamming on the keyboard by using this pattern. The app displays the current chord in the Roman numeral and suggests the expected next chord in an easy to understand way on a smartphone. This work investigates into the human computer interaction perspective of music performance. We use a smartphone app as a bridge, which assists musician to react faster in music jamming by transforming the complex music knowledge into a simple, unified and easy to understand format. Experiment result shows that this app can help the non-keyboardist musician to learn pop music jamming. It also shows that the app is useful to assist keyboardist in making key transpose and playing music in the key with many sharps and flats. We will use the same interface design to guide user on playing other chord progressions such as the jazz chord progression.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the challenge of achieving nuanced control and physical engagement with gestural interfaces in performance. Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer’s perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body’s physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.",

    "abstract": "Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have difficulties establishing themselves after their creation. A huge number of DMIs is presented every year and few of them actually remain in use. Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.",

    "abstract": "The development of the cushion-like musical interface called the sponge started about seven years ago. Since then, it was extensively used to perform in various settings. The sponge itself is described, but the main focus is on the evolution of the mapping strategies that are used. The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.",

The spatialization of reproduced audio is however highly dependent on the recording technique, the rendering method, and the loudspeaker configuration. While object-based audio production has proven to reduce the dependency on loudspeaker configurations, authoring tools are still considered to be difficult to interact with in current production environments. In this paper, we investigate the issues of spatialization techniques for object-based audio production and introduce the Spatial Audio Design Spaces (SpADS) framework, that provides insights into the spatial manipulation of object-based audio. Based on interviews with professional sound engineers, this morphological analysis clarifies the relationships between recording and rendering techniques that define audio-objects for 3D speaker configurations, allowing the analysis and the design of advanced object-based controllers as well.",

In this paper we define a set of six variables, and use them to describe and evaluate a number of platforms for participatory performances. Based on this evaluation, the Augmented Stage is introduced. Such concept describes how Augmented Reality techniques can be used to superimpose a performance stage with a virtual environment, populated with interactive elements. The manipulation of these objects allows spectators to contribute to the visual and sonic outcome of the performance through their mobile devices, while keeping their freedom to focus on the stage. An interactive acoustic rock performance based on this concept was staged. Questionnaires distributed to the audience and performers’ comments have been analyzed, contributing to an evaluation of the presented concept and platform done through the defined variables.",

This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer’s signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of \\<3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of  4800 packets per second ( 320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.",

    "abstract": "New technologies have led to the design of exciting interfaces for collaborative music making. However we still have very little understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes which occur during such interactions. To address this issue, we carried out a pilot study where we collected continuous behavioural, physiological, and performance related measures from pairs of improvising drummers. This paper presents preliminary findings, which could be useful for the evaluation and design of user-centred collaborative interfaces for musical creativity and expression.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines electronic instruments that are based on dynamical systems, where the behaviour of the instrument depends not only upon the immediate input to the instrument, but also on the past input. Five instruments are presented as case studies: Michel Waisvisz’ Cracklebox, Dylan Menzies’ Spiro, no-input mixing desk, the author’s Feedback Joypad, and microphone-loudspeaker feedback. Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instrument and the dynamical mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary, materialoriented approaches to composition and particularly to free improvisation where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest, and the process of exploration and discovery is an important part of the practice. Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for a self-tuning procedure for musical robots capable of continuous pitch-shifting. Such a technique is useful for robots consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented method consists of comparing a detuned string’s pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications and ideas for subsequent work on self-tuning musical robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the authors introduce a stand-alone synthesizer, “B.O.M.B. -Beat Of Magic Box –\" for electronic music sessions and live performances. “B.O.M.B.\" has a wireless communication system that synchronizes musical scale and tempo (BPM) between multiple devices. In addition, participants can change master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have been developed in electronic music field \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\]. The authors are interested in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface: Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre, and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3) Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability. In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization. In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer musical sessions.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the concept of end-user programming languages in music composition, and introduces the Manhattan system, which integrates formulas with a grid-based style of music sequencer. Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.",

To this end we propose a design approach that not only considers the materiality of the instrument, but that leverages it as a central part of the conception of the sonic quality, the control structuring and what generally falls under the umbrella of \"mapping\" design. As we will discuss, this extended computational matter-centric view is of benefit towards holistically understanding an “instrument\" gestural engagement, as it is realized through physical material, sonic gestural matter and felt human engagement.

Finger location on a violin fingerboard is measured using resistive sensors, allowing rapid detection of approximate pitch. The initial pitch estimate is then used to restrict the search space of an audio pitch tracking algorithm. Most audio-only pitch tracking algorithms face a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and latency, with longer analysis windows producing better pitch estimates at the cost of noticeable lag in a live performance environment. Conversely, sensor-only strategies struggle to achieve the fine pitch accuracy a human listener would expect. By combining the two approaches, high accuracy and low latency can be simultaneously achieved.",

    "abstract": "Conceiving digital musical instruments might be challenging in terms of spectator accessibility. Depending on the interface and the complexity of the software used as a transition between the controller and sound, a musician performance can be totally opaque for the audience and loose its interest. This paper examines the possibility of adding a visual feedback to help the public understanding, and add expressivity to the performance. It explores the various mapping organizations between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters, or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation of controllers, received a good opinion from the audience, highlighting the musical intention of the performers.",

We designed a set of body-related interaction and multi-modal feedback techniques and developed a singing voice synthesizer system that is controlled by the user’s mouth shapes and arm gestures. Based on the adaption of a number of digital media-related techniques such as face and body tracking, 3D rendering, singing voice synthesis and physical computing, we developed a media installation that allows users to perform an aria without real singing and provide the look and feel from a 20th century performance of an opera singer. We evaluated this system preliminarily with users.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the technologies, collaborative processes, and artistic intents of the musical composition Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer, which was composed by Timothy Polashek for percussionist Brad Meyer using a jointly created electroacoustic and interactive musical instrument. During performance, the percussionist equally manipulates and expresses through two surfaces, an iPad displaying an interactive touch screen and a snare drum augmented with various foreign objects, including a contact microphone adhered to the drumhead’s surface. A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer’s gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score, as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for the performer. Many compositional and technological approaches used in this project pay tribute to composer John Cage, since the premiere performance of Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer took place in 2012, the centennial celebration of Cage’s birth year.",

    "abstract": "The Chimaera is a touch-less, expressive, polyphonic and electronic music controller based on magnetic field sensing. An array of hall-effect sensors and their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium. These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial resolution and its low-latency (\\<1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward to integrate into any setup.",

The author presents significant design considerations, including improving of the user’s sense of depth and panorama, maintaining broad accessibility by integrating the system with Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software, and implementing a system that is portable and affordable. To provide the user with a heightened sense of sound spatialization over the traditional channel strip, the concept of depth is addressed directly using the stage metaphor. Sound sources are represented as colored spheres in a graphical user interface to provide the user with visual feedback. Moving sources back and forward controls volume, while left to right controls panning. To provide broader accessibility, the interface is configured to control mixing within the Ableton Live DAW. The author also discusses future plans to expand functionality and evaluate the system.",

The skeleton of a subject is analyzed in real time and displayed as an abstract avatar as well as sonified based on mappings and rules to make the interplay experience lively and rewarding. A series of musical pieces have been composed for the interface following cueing strategies. In addition a second display, “the prompter\" guides the users through the piece. 3DinMotion has been developed from scratch and natively, leading to a system with a very low latency, making it suitable for real time music interactions. In addition, 3DinMotion is fully compatible with the OpenSoundControl (OSC) protocol, allowing expansion to commonly used musical and sound design applications.",

These activities impart positive skills through multi-media content delivery for all learning types. The program is designed to test practices for engaging at-risk young people from urban areas in the construction and performance of new electronic instruments. The goal is to open up the world of electronic music performance to a new generation of young digital artists and to replace negative social behaviours with creative outlets for expression through technology and performance.

To this end, we propose a new model for computer music system design on touchscreen devices, combining both pen/stylus input and multitouch gestures. Such a model surpasses the barrier of touchscreen-based keyboard input, preserving the primary interaction of touch and direct manipulation throughout the development of a complex musical program. We have implemented an iPad software application utilizing these principles, called “Auraglyph.\" Auraglyph offers a number of fundamental audio processing and control operators, as well as facilities for structured input and output. All of these software objects are created, parameterized, and interconnected via stylus and touch input. Underlying this application is an advanced handwriting recognition framework, LipiTk, which can be trained to recognize both alphanumeric characters and arbitrary figures, shapes, and patterns.",

    "abstract": "Many musical interfaces have used the musical conductor metaphor, allowing users to control the expressive aspects of a performance by imitating the gestures of conductors. In most of them, the rules to control these expressive aspects are predefined and users have to adapt to them. Other works have studied conductors’ gestures in relation to the performance of the orchestra. The goal of this study is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years many touch screen interfaces have been designed and used for musical control. When compared with their physical counterparts, current control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty. This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth’s interaction design, and user experience results of using such an interface.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a rationale for choosing acoustic localisation techniques as an alternative to other principles to provide spatial positions in interactive locative audio applications (ILAA). By comparing positioning technology in existing ILAAs to the expected performance of acoustic positioning systems (APS), we can evaluate if APS would perform equivalently in a particular application. In this paper, the titles of NIME conference proceedings from 2001 to 2013 were searched for presentations on ILAA using positioning technology. Over 80 relevant articles were found. For each of the systems we evaluated if and why APS would be a contender or not. The results showed that for over 73 percent of the reviewed applications, APS could possibly provide competitive alternatives and at very low cost.",

    "abstract": "We propose ways of enriching the timbral potential of gestural sonic material captured via piezo or contact microphones, through latency-free convolution of the microphone signal with grains from a sound corpus. This creates a new way to combine the sonic richness of large sound corpora, easily accessible via navigation through a timbral descriptor space, with the intuitive gestural interaction with a surface, captured by any contact microphone. We use convolution to excite the grains from the corpus via the microphone input, capturing the contact interaction sounds, which allows articulation of the corpus by hitting, scratching, or strumming a surface with various parts of the hands or objects. We also show how changes of grains have to be carefully handled, how one can smoothly interpolate between neighbouring grains, and finally evaluate the system against previous attempts.",

An experiment was performed in order to investigate which kind of gestures listeners associate to synthesised sounds produced using physical models, corresponding to three categories of sound: sustained, iterative and impulsive. The results of the experiment show that listeners perform similar gestures when controlling sounds from the different categories. We used such gestures in order to create the mapping strategy between the Gloves and the physically based synthesis engine.",

    "abstract": "Real-time audio analysis has great potential for being used to create musically responsive applications in live performances. There have been many examples of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.",

    "abstract": "Mobile music applications are typically quite limiting to musicians, as they either attempt to mimic non-touch screen interfaces or do not offer enough control. Pitch Canvas is a musical interface that was built specifically for the touchscreen. Pitches are laid out in a hexagonal pattern that allow for easy scale, chord, and arpeggiation patterns. Notes are played by touch, but are sustained through continuous movement. Pitch bends can be achieved by passing through the space between the notes. Its current implementation runs only on Apple iPad tablet computers using a libPd to convert user interaction into audio. An iPad overlay offers physical feedback for the circles as well as the pitch bend area between the circles. A performable version of the application has been built, though several active developments allow alternative sonic interpretation of the gestures, enhanced visual response to user interaction, and the ability to control the instrument with multiple devices.",

    "abstract": "For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already ‘play’ their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch) with the player’s hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player’s hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz \\[TAPIR article\\]. This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor. From the generator that is attached on the player’s hand, the TAPIR signal transfers to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player’s gesture is captured as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer on aforementioned system.",

Following these criteria, we literally incorporated a musical score onto the surface of the instrument as a way of continuously controlling several parameters of the sound synthesis.

    "abstract": "The El-Lamellophone (El-La) is a Lamellophone hyperinstrument incorporating electronic sensors and integrated DSP. Initial investigations have been made into digitallycontrolled physical actuation of the acoustic tines. An embedded Linux micro-computer supplants the laptop. A piezoelectric pickup is mounted to the underside of the body of the instrument for direct audio acquisition providing a robust signal with little interference. The signal is used for electric sound-reinforcement, creative signal processing and audio analysis developed in Puredata (Pd). This signal inputs and outputs the micro computer via stereo 1/8th inch phono jacks. Sensors provide gesture recognition affording the performer a broader, more dynamic range of musical human computer interaction (MHCI) over specific DSP functions. Work has been done toward electromagnetic actuation of the tines, aiming to allow performer control and sensation via both traditional Lamellophone techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared human/computer control of the resulting sound. The goal is to achieve this without compromising the traditional sound production methods of the acoustic instrument while leveraging inherent performance gestures with embedded continuous controller values essential to MHCI. The result is an intuitive, performer designed, hybrid electro-acoustic instrument, idiomatic computer interface, and robotic acoustic instrument in one framework.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic feedback controllers (AFCs) are typically applied to solve feedback problems evident in applications such as public address (PA) systems, hearing aids, and speech applications. Applying the techniques of AFCs to different contexts, such as musical performance, sound installations, and product design, presents a unique insight into the research of embodied sonic interfaces and environments. This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile environments and continuous coupling of users’ audible actions with sonically augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with some future research directions based on the prototypes and proposes several other potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.",

We begin by outlining primary challenges associated with DMI design, focussing on the specific problems Orphion seeks to address such as requirements for haptic feedback from the device. Orphion achieves this by incorporating an interaction model based on tonally tuned virtual “pads\" in user-configurable layouts, where the pitch and timbre associated with each pad depends on the initial point of touch, touch point size and size variation, and position after the initial touch. These parameters control a physical model for sound generation with visual feedback provided via the iPad display. We present findings from the research and development process including design revisions made in response to user testing. Finally, conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the instrument based on large-scale user feedback.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the findings of two exploratory studies. In these studies participants performed a series of image-sound association tasks. The aim of the studies was to investigate the perceived similarity and the efficacy of two multidimensional mappings each consisting of three audio-visual associations. The purpose of the mappings is to enable visual control of corpus-based concatenative synthesis. More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis revealed no significant differences in the participant’s responses between the three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences in the ability of the participants’ to detect the correct image depending on which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success rate of the participant responses.",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines a theoretical framework for creative technology based on two contrasting processes: divergent exploration and convergent optimisation. We claim that these two cases require different gesture-to-parameter mapping properties. Results are presented from a user experiment that motivates this theory. The experiment was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: “Sonic Zoom”. Participants were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the “convergent” stage of creation. The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the “divergent” aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both 2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable, separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent tasks.",

The work is based on—but also departs from—John Cage’s Reunion, which premiered at the Sightsoundsystems Festival, Toronto, 1968. In the original performance, Cage and Marcel Duchamp played chess on an electronic board constructed by Lowell Cross. The board ‘conducted’ various electronic sound sources played by Cross, Gordon Mumma, David Tudor, and David Behrman, using photoresistors fitted under the squares \\[1\\]. Reunion2012, on the other hand, utilises magnet sensors via an Arduino. Like in Cage’s Variations V, this resulted in a musical situation where the improvising musicians had full control over their own sound, but no control regarding when their sound may be heard. In addition to a concert version, this paper also describes an interactive installation based on the same hardware.",

    "abstract": "In our current era, where smartphones are commonplace and buzzwords like “the internet of things,\" “wearable tech,\" and “augmented reality\" are ubiquitous, translating performance gestures into data and intuitively mapping it to control musical/visual parameters in the realm of computing should be trivial; but it isn’t. Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one’s musical craft. These skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community, it’s unclear that we should even draw distinctions between ’artist’ and ’technician’, because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However, what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will be presented. It enables one to bypass the technical hurdles listed above in favor of immediate experimentation with musical practice and wireless sensing. A unique software architecture will also be unveiled that enables one to quickly and intuitively process and map unpredictable numbers and types of wireless data streams, the Digital Data Workstation.",

Considerations on EMC and how gestures affect the experience of music inform different mapping strategies. Our intent is to enhance the expressiveness and the liveness of performance by tracking gestures via a multimodal motion capture system and to use motion data to control several features of the music. After a review of recent research in the field, a proposed application of such theories to a performance with electric guitar and live electronics will follow, focusing both on aspects of meaning formation and motion capturing.",

The development is described in two parts. Firstly, we consider the design of the interface or physical controller. Following this we describe the development of a specific sonic character, mapping approach and performance. In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance. In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed. Further, the utility of a movement focused design approach is discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the OWL stage effects pedal and aims to present the device within the context of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research. The OWL is a dedicated, programmable audio device designed to provide an alternative to the use of laptop computers for bespoke audio processing on stage for music performance. By creating a software framework that allows the user to program their own code for the hardware in C++, the OWL project makes it possible to use homemade audio processing on stage without the need for a laptop running a computer music environment such as Pure Data or Supercollider. Moving away from the general-purpose computer to a dedicated audio device means that some of the potential problems and technical complexity of performing with a laptop computer onstage can be avoided, allowing the user to focus more of their attention on the musical performance. Within the format of a traditional guitar ’stomp box’, the OWL aims to integrate seamlessly into a guitarist’s existing pedal board setup, and in this way presents as an example of a ubiquitous and tangible computing device -a programmable computer designed to fit into an existing mode of musical performance whilst being transparent in use.",

Measurements of listeners’ physiology, while they are listening to recorded music of their own choosing, are used to create a regression model that predicts features extracted from music with the help of the listeners’ physiological response patterns. This information can be used as a control signal to drive musical composition and synthesis of new sounds an approach involving concatenative sound synthesis is suggested. An evaluation study was conducted to test the feasibility of the model. A multiple linear regression model and an artificial neural network model were evaluated against a constant regressor, or dummy model. The dummy model outperformed the other models in prediction accuracy, but the artificial neural network model achieved significant correlations between predictions and target values for many acoustic features.",

The timbre morpher is a hybrid analysis and synthesis technique based on Spectral Modeling Synthesis (an additive and subtractive modeling technique). The musical installation forms an interactive soundtrack in response to the series of Rosso Luana marble sculptures Shapes in the Clouds, I, II, III, IV & V by artist Peter Randall-Page, exhibited at the Peninsula Arts Gallery in Devon, UK, from 1 February to 29 March 2014. The timbre morphing system is used to transform live input captured at each sculpture with a discrete microphone array, by morphing towards noisy source signals that have been associated with each sculpture as part of a pre-determined musical structure. The resulting morphed audio is then fed-back to the gallery via a five-channel speaker array. Visitors are encouraged to walk freely through the installation and interact with the sound world, creating unique audio morphs based on their own movements, voices, and incidental sounds.",

    "abstract": "Co-located tabletop tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for music performance are known for promoting multi-player collaboration with a shared interface, yet it is still unclear how to best support the awareness of the workspace in terms of understanding individual actions and the other group members actions, in parallel. In this paper, we investigate the effects of providing auditory feedback using ambisonics spatialisation, aimed at informing users about the location of the tangibles on the tabletop surface, with groups of mixed musical backgrounds. Participants were asked to improvise music on \"SoundXY4: The Art of Noise\", a tabletop system that includes sound samples inspired by Russolo’s taxonomy of noises. We compared spatialisation vs. no-spatialisation conditions, and findings suggest that, when using spatialisation, there was a clearer workspace awareness, and a greater engagement in the musical activity as an immersive experience.",

Based on a view of music pedagogy that emphasizes expressive, full-body communication early in the learning process, Andante promotes an understanding of the music rooted in the body, taking advantage of walking as one of the most fundamental human rhythms. We describe three example visualizations on a preliminary prototype as well as applications extending our examples for practice feedback, improvisation and composition. Through our project, we reflect on some high level considerations for the NIME community.",

    "abstract": "When performing a piece, a pianist’s interpretation is communicated both through the sound produced and through body gestures. We present PiaF (Piano Follower), a prototype for augmenting piano performance by measuring gesture variations. We survey other augmented piano projects, several of which focus on gestural recognition, and present our prototype which uses machine learning techniques for gesture classification and estimation of gesture variations in real-time. Our implementation uses the Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data. During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures, or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time, and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond live performance, including pedagogy and embodiment of recorded performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the process of appropriation in digital musical instrument performance, examining the effect of instrument complexity on the emergence of personal playing styles. Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument’s affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.",

It presents a discussion on works in which mechatronics is used to investigate new and traditionally perceived as “extra-musical\" sonic territories, and introduces Rasper: a new mechatronic noise-intoner that features an electromechanical apparatus to create noise physically, while regulating it rhythmically and timbrally.",

    "abstract": "An interactive music instrument museum experience for children of 10-12 years is presented. Equipped with tablet devices, the children are sent on a treasure hunt. Based on given sound samples, the participants have to identify the right musical instrument (harpsichord, double bass, viola) out of an instrument collection. As the right instrument is located, a challenge of playing an application on the tablet is initiated. This application is an interactive digital representation of the found instrument, mimicking some of its key playing techniques, using a simplified scrolling on screen musical notation. The musical performance of the participant is graded on a point scale. After completion of the challenge, the participants’ performances of the three instruments are played back simultaneously, constituting a composition. A qualitative evaluation of the application in a focus group interview with school children revealed that the children were more engaged when playing with the interactive application than when only watching a music video.",

In the Wacom use case, the camera is between the hand and the surface. In the PVC use case, the camera is under the transparent sheet and tracks the hand through it. The aim of this research is to explore hovering motion surrounding the touch interaction on the surface and include properties of such motion in the musical interaction. We present our unifying software, called AirPiano, that discretises the 3D space into ’keys’ and proposes several mapping strategies with the available dimensions. These control dimensions are mapped onto a modified HandSketch sound engine that achieves multitimbral pitch-synchronous point cloud granulation.",

Since the accuracy of previous audio-based transcription systems is not satisfactory, we propose an innovative visual-based automatic music transcription system named claVision to perform piano music transcription. Instead of processing the music audio, the system performs the transcription only from the video performance captured by a camera mounted over the piano keyboard. claVision can be used as a transcription tool, but it also has other applications such as music education.

    "abstract": "Many new melodic instruments use a touch sensitive surface with notes arranged in a two-dimensional grid. Most of these arrange notes in chromatic half-steps along the horizontal axis and in intervals of fourths along the vertical axis. Although many alternatives exist, this arrangement, which resembles that of a bass guitar, is quickly becoming the de facto standard. In this study we present experimental evidence that grid based instruments are significantly easier to play when we tune adjacent rows in Major thirds rather than fourths. We have developed a grid-based instrument as an iPad app that has sold 8,000 units since 2012. To test our proposed alternative tuning, we taught a group twenty new users to play basic chords on our app, using both the standard tuning and our proposed alternative. Our results show that the Major thirds tuning is much easier to learn, even for users that have previous experience playing guitar.",

In both cases, the design process is not focused on creating DMIs for a community with a particular culture - with established instruments, repertoire and playing styles - outside European and North American traditions. This challenge motivated our research. In this paper, we discuss lessons learned during an one-year project called Batebit. Our approach was based on Design Thinking methodology, comprising cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation.

    "abstract": "Evaluation has been suggested to be one of the main trends in current NIME research. However, the meaning of the term for the community may not be as clear as it seems. In order to explore this issue, we have analyzed all papers and posters published in the proceedings of the NIME conference from 2012 to 2014. For each publication that explicitly mentioned the term evaluation, we looked for: a) What targets and stakeholders were considered? b) What goals were set? c) What criteria were used? d) What methods were used? e) How long did the evaluation last? Results show different understandings of evaluation, with little consistency regarding the usage of the word. Surprisingly in some cases, not even basic information such as goal, criteria and methods were provided. In this paper, we attempt to provide an idea of what evaluation means for the NIME community, pushing the discussion towards how could we make a better use of evaluation on NIME design and what criteria should be used regarding each goal.",

    "abstract": "Electroacoustic music has a longstanding relationship with gesture and space. This paper marks the start of a project investigating acousmatic spatial imagery, real gestural behaviour and ultimately the formation of tangible acousmatic images. These concepts are explored experimentally using motion tracking in a source-sound recording context, interactive parameter-mapping sonification in three-dimensional high-order ambisonics, composition and performance. The spatio-musical role of physical actions in relation to instrument excitation is used as a point of departure for embodying physical spatial gestures in the creative process. The work draws on how imagery for music is closely linked with imagery for music-related actions.",

We describe the use of Internet of Things technologies to connect an acoustic guitar to its digital footprint – a record of how it was designed, built and played. We introduce the approach of crafting interactive decorative inlay into the body of an instrument that can then be scanned using mobile devices to reveal its digital footprint. We describe the design and construction of an augmented acoustic guitar called Carolan alongside activities to build its digital footprint through documented encounters with twenty-seven players in a variety of settings. We reveal the design challenge of mapping the different surfaces of the instrument to various facets of its footprint so as to afford appropriate experiences to players, audiences and technicians. We articulate an agenda for further research on the topic of connecting instruments to their social histories, including capturing and performing digital footprints and creating personalized and legacy experiences.",

    "abstract": "Much of the challenge and appeal in remixing music comes from manipulating samples. Typically, identifying distinct samples of a song requires expertise in music production software. Additionally, it is difficult to visualize similarities and differences between all samples of a song simultaneously and use this to select samples. MusicMapper is a web application that allows nonexpert users to find and visualize distinctive samples from a song without any manual intervention, and enables remixing by having users play back clusterings of such samples. This is accomplished by splitting audio from the Soundcloud API into appropriately-sized spectrograms, and applying the t-SNE algorithm to visualize these spectrograms in two dimensions. Next, we apply k-means to guide the user’s eye toward related clusters and set $k=26$ to enable playback of the clusters by pressing keys on an ordinary keyboard. We present the source code (https://github.com/fatsmcgee/MusicMappr) and a demo video (http://youtu.be/mvD6e1uiO8k) of the MusicMapper web application that can be run in most modern browsers.",

    "abstract": "The haptic hand is a greatly simplified robotic hand that is designed to mirror the human hand and provide haptic force feedback for applications in music. The fingers of the haptic hand device are laid out to align with four of the fingers of the human hand. A key is placed on each of the fingers so that a human hand can perform music by interacting with the keys. The haptic hand is distinguished from other haptic keyboards in the sense that each finger is meant to stay with a particular key. The haptic hand pro- motes unencumbered interaction with the keys. The user can easily position a finger over a key and press downward to activate it—the user does not need to insert his or her fingers into an unwieldy exoskeleton or set of thimbles.

    "abstract": "Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians influence the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality. More specifically, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We suggest that the perceived causality between a performer’s gestures and the musical result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of an experimental study investigating the effect of visual augmentations on audience’s inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of performances with DMIs impacts the audience’s causal inferences about the performer. In particular we show that visual augmentations help highlight the influence of the musician when parts of the music are automated, and help clarify complex mappings between gestures and sounds. Finally we discuss the potential wider implications for assessing liveness in the design of new musical interfaces.",

    "abstract": "We present Reflets, a mixed-reality environment for musical performances that allows for freely displaying virtual content on stage, such as 3D virtual musical interfaces or visual augmentations of instruments and performers. It relies on spectators and performers revealing virtual objects by slicing through them with body parts or objects, and on planar slightly reflective transparent panels that combine the stage and audience spaces. In this paper, we describe the approach and implementation challenges of Reflets. We then demonstrate that it matches the requirements of musical performances. It allows for placing virtual content anywhere on large stages, even overlapping with physical elements and provides a consistent rendering of this content for large numbers of spectators. It also preserves non-verbal communication between the audience and the performers, and is inherently engaging for the spectators. We finally show that Reflets opens musical performance opportunities such as augmented interaction between musicians and novel techniques for 3D sound shapes manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Biofeedback tools generally use visualizations to display physiological information to the user. As such, these tools are incompatible with visually demanding tasks such as driving. While auditory or haptic biofeedback may be used in these cases, the additional sensory channels can increase workload or act as a nuisance to the user. A number of studies, however, have shown that music can improve mood and concentration, while also reduce aggression and boredom. Here, we propose an intervention that combines the benefits of biofeedback and music to help users regulate their stress response while performing a visual task (driving a car simulator). Our approach encourages slow breathing by adjusting the quality of the music in response to the user’s breathing rate. We evaluate the intervention on a 2$\\times$2 design with music and auditory biofeedback as independent variables. Our results indicate that our music-biofeedback intervention leads to lower arousal (reduced electrodermal activity and increased heart rate variability) than music alone, auditory biofeedback alone and a control condition.",

A unique one-to-one mapping enables the performer to precisely crossfade among a set of looped audio wave files, creating a conveniently portable system for navigating through a complex timbre space. The axes of the timbre space can be reconfigured by replacing the wave files stored in the flash memory.",

    "abstract": "Our experiment, Emotion in Motion, has amassed the world’s largest database of human physiology associated with emotion in response to the presentation of various selections of musical works. What began as a doctoral research study has grown to include the emotional responses to musical experience from over ten thousand participants across the world, from installations in Dublin, New York City, Norway, Singapore, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The most recent iteration of is currently underway in Taipei City, Taiwan. Preparation for this installation provided an opportunity to reimagine the architecture of , allowing for a wider range of potential applications than were originally possible with the original tools that drove the experiment. Now more than an experiment, is a framework for developing myriad emotional/musical/biomusical interactions with multiple co-located or remote participants. This paper describes the development of this open-source framework and includes discussion of its various components: hardware agnostic sensor inputs, refined physiological signal processing tools, and a public database of data collected during various instantiations of applications built on the framework. We also discuss our ongoing work with this tool, and provide the reader with other potential applications that they might realize in using .",

This paper describes the motivation and process of iteratively designing a musical instrument and interactive sound installation based on imagining the sounds of this extinct dinosaur. We used scientific research as a starting point to create a means of sound production and resonator, using a 3D model obtained from Computed Topology (CT) scans of a Corythosaurus skull and an endocast of its crest and nasal passages. Users give voice to the dinosaur by blowing into a mouthpiece, exciting a larynx mechanism and resonating the sound through the hadrosaur’s full-scale nasal cavities and skull. This action allows an embodied glimpse into an ancient past. Users know the dinosaur through the controlled exhalation of their breath, how the compression of the lungs leads to a whisper or a roar.",

    "abstract": "This paper documents the development of ml.lib: a set of open-source tools designed for employing a wide range of machine learning techniques within two popular real-time programming environments, namely Max and Pure Data. ml.lib is a cross-platform, lightweight wrapper around Nick Gillian’s Gesture Recognition Toolkit, a C++ library that includes a wide range of data processing and machine learning techniques. ml.lib adapts these techniques for real-time use within popular data-flow IDEs, allowing instrument designers and performers to integrate robust learning, classification and mapping approaches within their existing workflows. ml.lib has been carefully de-signed to allow users to experiment with and incorporate ma-chine learning techniques within an interactive arts context with minimal prior knowledge. A simple, logical and consistent, scalable interface has been provided across over sixteen exter-nals in order to maximize learnability and discoverability. A focus on portability and maintainability has enabled ml.lib to support a range of computing architectures—including ARM—and operating systems such as Mac OS, GNU/Linux and Win-dows, making it the most comprehensive machine learning implementation available for Max and Pure Data.",

Graphical control elements that form the control interface can be freely edited and exchanged to and from any device in the network, doing away with the need for a separate server or editing application. All graphical elements representing the same parameter will have their value synchronized through the network mechanisms. Some practical considerations surrounding the implementation of this idea like automatic layout of control, editing interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices and auto-discovery of network nodes are discussed. Finally, GoOSC, a mobile application implementing these ideas is presented.",

In order to do so, flexible algorithms were designed with the capacity of working even with an imprecise placement of the sensors. This makes it easy and accessible for all potential users. At least 4 sensors are required: 2 for the front and 2 for the back; this prototype uses 6. The sensors are rather inexpensive, widening the economic availability. For each individual musician, the algorithms are capable of “per- sonalising” postures in order to create consistent evaluations; the results of which may be, but are not limited to: new musical interfaces, educational analysis of technique, or music controllers. In building a prototype for the algorithms, data was acquired by wiring the sensors to a data-logger. The algorithms and tests were implemented using MATLAB. After designing the algorithms, various tests were run in order to prove their reliability. These determined that indeed the algorithms work to a sufficient degree of certainty, allowing for a reliable classification of a musician’s posture or position.",

    "abstract": "Based on a combination of novel mapping techniques and carefully designed sound engines, I present an augmented hybrid piano specifically designed for improvisation. The mapping technique, originally developed for other control interfaces but here adapted to the piano keyboard, is based on a dynamic vectorization of control parameters, allowing both wild sonic exploration and minute intimate expression. The original piano sound is used as the sole sound source, subjected to processing techniques such as virtual resonance strings, dynamic buffer shuffling, and acoustic and virtual feedback. Thanks to speaker and microphone placement, the acoustic and processed sounds interact in both directions and blend into one new instrument. This also allows for unorthodox playing (knocking, plucking, shouting). Processing parameters are controlled from the keyboard playing alone, allowing intuitive control of complex processing by ear, integrating expressive musical playing with sonic exploration. The instrument is not random, but somewhat unpredictable. This feeds into the improvisation, defining a particular idiomatics of the instruments. Hence, the instrument itself is an essential part of the musical work. Performances include concerts in UK, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Sweden, in solos and ensembles, performed by several pianists. Variations of this hybrid instrument for digital keyboards are also presented.",

One particular challenge is that humans easily follow scores and chord charts, adapt these to new performance plans, and understand media locations in musical terms (beats and measures), while computer music systems often use rigid and even numerical representations that are difficult to work with. We present new formalisms and representations, and a corresponding implementation, where musical material in various media is synchronized, where musicians can quickly alter the performance order by specifying (re-)arrangements of the material, and where interfaces are supported in a natural way by music notation.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Peripipe, a tangible remote control for a music player that comes in the shape of a wooden tobacco pipe. The design is based on breath control, using sips and puffs as control commands. An atmospheric pressure sen- sor in the Peripipe senses changes in the air pressure. Based on these changes, the pipe determines when the user per- forms a puff, double-puff, sip, double-sip or a long puff or long sip action, and wirelessly sends commands to a smart- phone running the music player. Additionally, the Perip- ipe provides fumeovisual feedback, using color-illuminated smoke to display the system status. With the form fac- tor, the materials used, the interaction through breath, and the ephemeral feedback we aim to emphasize the emotional component of listening to music that, in our eyes, is not very well reflected in traditional remote controls.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the sound art installation Doppelgänger. In Doppelgänger, we combine an artistic concept on a large scale with a high degree of control over timbre and dynamics. This puts great demands on the technical aspects of the work. The installation consists of seven 3.5 meters-tall objects weighing a total of 1500 kilos. Doppelgänger transfers one soundscape into another using audio analysis, mapping, and computer-controlled acoustic sound objects. The technical realization is based on hammer mechanisms actuated by powerful solenoids, driven by a network of Arduino boards with high power PWM outputs, and a Max-patch running audio analysis and mapping. We look into the special requirements in mechanics for large-scale projects. Great care has been taken in the technical design to ensure that the resulting work is scalable both in numbers of elements and in physical dimensions. This makes our findings easily applicable to other projects of a similar nature.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation and easy access to a new breed of ARM-based single-board computers has promoted an increased usage of these platforms in the creation of self-contained Digital Music Instruments. These directly incorporate all of the necessary processing power for tasks such as sensor signal acquisition, control data processing and audio synthesis. They can also run full Linux operating systems, through which domain-specific languages for audio computing facilitate a low entry barrier for the community. In computer music the adoption of these computing platforms will naturally depend on their ability to withstand the demanding computing tasks associated to high-quality audio synthesis. In the context of computer music practice there are few reports about this quantification for practical purposes. This paper aims at presenting the results of performance tests of SuperCollider running on the BeagleBone Black, a popular mid-tier single-board computer, while performing commonly used audio synthesis techniques.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the stage metaphor and the channel strip metaphor in terms of performance. Traditionally, music mixing consoles employ a channels strip control metaphor for adjusting parameters such as volume and panning of each track. An alternative control metaphor, the so-called stage metaphor lets the user adjust volume and panning by positioning tracks relative to a virtual listening position. In this study test participants are given the task to adjust volume and panning of one channel (in mixes consisting of three channels) in order to replicate a series of simple pre-rendered mixes. They do this using (1) a small physical mixing controller and (2) using an iPad app, which implements a simple stage metaphor interface. We measure how accurately they are able to replicate mixes in terms of volume and panning and how fast they are at doing so. Results reveal that performance is surprisingly similar and thus we are not able to detect any significant difference in performance between the two interfaces. Qualitative data however, suggests that the stage metaphor is largely favoured for its intuitive interaction - confirming earlier studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the ideas and mapping strategies behind a performance system that uses a combination of motion tracking and feature extraction tools to manage complex multichannel audio materials for real-time music composition. The use of embodied metaphors within these mappings is seen as a means of managing the complexity of a musical performance across multiple modalities. In particular, we will investigate how these mapping strategies may facilitate the creation of performance systems whose accessibility and richness are enhanced by common integrating bases. A key focus for this work is the investigation of the embodied image schema theories of Lakoff and Johnson alongside similarly embodied metaphorical models within Smalley’s influential theory of electroacoustic music (spectromorphology). These metaphors will be investigated for their use as grounding structural components and dynamics for creative practices and musical interaction design. We argue that pairing metaphorical models of forces with environmental forms may have particular significance for the design of complex mappings for digital music performance.",

    "abstract": "Quality assessment of jazz improvisation is a multi-faceted, high-level cognitive task routinely performed by educators in university jazz programs and other discriminating music listeners. In this pilot study, we present a novel dataset of 88 MIDI jazz piano improvisations with ratings of creativity, technical proficiency, and aesthetic appeal provided by four jazz experts, and we detail the design of a feature set that can represent some of the rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, and other expressive attributes humans recognize as salient in assessment of performance quality. Inherent subjectivity in these assessments is inevitable, yet the recognition of performance attributes by which humans perceive quality has wide applicability to related tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR) community and jazz pedagogy. Preliminary results indicate that several musiciologically-informed features of relatively low computational complexity perform reasonably well in predicting performance quality labels via ordinary least squares regression.",

Two exploratory studies which used modular-muse are described here with different approaches; a two day build your own instrument workshop where participants learned how to use both hardware and software concurrently to control synthesized sounds and trigger solenoids, and a middle school music classroom where the focus was only on programming for sound synthesis using the modular-muse Pd library.

It is a spherical hand-held wireless controller embedded with various sensor technologies and interactive lighting. The lighting was a key conceptual component in the instrument’s creation both as a theatrical prop and also as an interface for musical performance as it helps to address conceptual challenges and opportunities posed by the instrument’s spherical form. This paper begins by providing a brief description of the Pearl and its use as a spherical instrument. We then discuss mapping the Pearl both to generate sound and control its interactive lighting, and identify different strategies for its use. Strategies we identify include feedback regarding performer gesture, information about the state of the instrument, and use as an aesthetic performance component.",

    "abstract": "Live music making can be understood as an enactive process, whereby musical experiences are created through human action. This suggests that musical worlds coevolve with their agents through repeated sensorimotor interactions with the environment (where the music is being created), and at the same time cannot be separated from their sociocultural contexts. This paper investigates this claim by exploring ways in which technology, physiology, and context are bound up within two different musical scenarios: live electronic musical performance; and person-centred arts applications of NIMEs. In this paper I outline an ethnographic and phenomenological enquiry into my experiences as both a performer of live electronic and electro-instrumental music, as well as my extensive background in working with new technologies in various therapeutic and person-centred artistic situations. This is in order to explore the sociocultural and technological contexts in which these activities take place. I propose that by understanding creative musical participation as a highly contextualised practice, we may discover that the greatest impact of rapidly developing technological resources is their ability to afford richly diverse, personalised, and embodied forms of music making. I argue that this is applicable over a wide range of musical communities.",

    "abstract": "The Hayward Tuning Vine is a software interface for exploring the system of microtonal tuning known as Just Intonation. Based ultimately on prime number relationships, harmonic space in Just Intonation is inherently multidimensional, with each prime number tracing a unique path in space. Taking this multidimensionality as its point of departure, the Tuning Vine interface assigns a unique angle and colour to each prime number, along with aligning melodic pitch height to vertical height on the computer screen. These features allow direct and intuitive interaction with Just Intonation. The inclusion of a transposition function along each prime number axis also enables potentially unlimited exploration of harmonic space within prime limit 23. Currently available as desktop software, a prototype for a hardware version has also been constructed, and future tablet app and hardware versions of the Tuning Vine are planned that will allow tangible as well as audiovisual interaction with microtonal harmonic space.",

    "abstract": "Locative music experiences are often non-linear and as such they are co-created, as the final arrangement of the music heard is guided by the movements of the user. We note an absence of principles and guidelines regarding how composers should approach the structuring of such locative soundtracks. For instance, how does one compose for a non-linear, indeterminate experience using linear pre-composed placed sounds, where fixed musical time is situated into the indeterminate time of the user’s experience? Furthermore, how does one create a soundtrack that is suitable for the location, but also functions as a coherent musical structure? We explore these questions by analyzing an existing ‘placed sound’ work from a traditional music theory perspective and in doing so reveal some structural principals from ‘fixed’ musical forms can also support the composition of contemporary locative music experiences.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s of virtual machines which we propose to call a ‘cloud-orchestra’. Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.",

Using co-reflection with four musical therapists and literature research, design guidelines related to this specific user-group and context are formed. This leads to a concept of which the most relevant aspects are discussed, before describing the user studies. Finally, the plan for the redesign is discussed. The WamBam has unique possibilities to deal with the low motor skills and cognitive abilities of severely intellectually disabled users while music therapists benefit from the greater versatility and portability of this design compared to other musical instruments. A prototype was tested with twenty users. Participants proved to be triggered positively by the WamBam, but three limiting usability issues were found. These issues were used as the fundamentals for a second prototype. Music therapists confirm the value of the WamBam for their practice.",

    "abstract": "The Internet holds a lot of potential as a music listening, collaboration, and performance space. It has become commonplace to stream music and video of musical performance over the web. However, the goal of playing rhythmically synchronized music over long distances has remained elusive due to the latency inherent in networked communication. The farther apart two artists are from one another, the greater the delay. Furthermore, latency times can change abruptly with no warning. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a distributed, synchronized musical instrument that allows performers to play together over long distances, despite latency. We describe one such instrument, MalLo, which combats latency by predicting a musician’s action before it is completed. MalLo sends information about a predicted musical note over the Internet before it is played, and synthesizes this note at a collaborator’s location at nearly the same moment it is played by the performer. MalLo also protects against latency spikes by sending the prediction data across multiple network paths, with the intention of routing around latency.",

We describe and discuss the methods to create, synchronize and combine the aspects of space, object, music and interaction for the development of resonate. The realized space-filling tangible installation allowed visitors to interact with different interaction objects and change therefore the musical expression as well as the visual response and aesthetic. After a non-formal quality evaluation of this installation we changed some aspects which resulted in a more refined version which we will also discuss here.",

    "abstract": "Improvising to non-modal chord progressions such as those found in jazz necessitates switching between the different scales implied by each chord. This work attempted to simplify improvisation by delegating the process of switching scales to a computer. An open-source software MIDI remapper called ChordEase was developed that dynamically alters the pitch of notes, in order to fit them to the chord scales of a predetermined song. ChordEase modifies the behavior of ordinary MIDI instruments, giving them new interfaces that permit non-modal music to be approached as if it were modal. Multiple instruments can be remapped simultaneously, using a variety of mapping functions, each optimized for a particular musical role. Harmonization and orchestration can also be automated. By facilitating the selection of scale tones, ChordEase enables performers to focus on other aspects of improvisation, and thus creates new possibilities for musical expression.",

With the programmable text animation , we turn plain text into a highly audiovisual medium and a musical interface which is visually expressive. We describe a concrete technical realization of the concept using Web Audio API, WebGL and GLSL shaders. We further show a number of examples that illustrate instances of the concept in various scenarios ranging from simple textual visualization to live coding environments. Lastly, we present an audiovisual music piece that involves live writing augmented by the visualization technique.",

    "abstract": "Pedagogical research demonstrates theories and practices of perception or production of melodic or harmonic “intonation”, i.e. the realization of pitch accuracy. There are software and hardware to help students improve intonation. Those tools have various functions. Nevertheless, they still miss something which could benefit users very much. Even worse, they are not easy to be revised. Most importantly, there should be more amusing and engaging interaction between a tuning trainer and a user which is able to exchange roles of tuner and player. In this research, we implement an open-source program named “Harmonic Intonation Trainer” in Pure Data. It includes most of essential elements of a smart tuner. A user can tune his pitch while optionally hearing (through earphones) the target pitch and other harmonic intervals in respective octaves. Moreover, in its interactive accompanist mode, a user’s input pitch serves as the reference frequency; the program follows his intonation to generate corresponding harmonic intervals. Additionally, user can straightforwardly edit all parameters and patches by Pure Data. Any adoption or revision is absolutely welcome. Finally, we will initiate another research to test and to inspect experimental results from student orchestras so that its future version is expected to be more sophisticated.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a software extension to the Reactable entitled Gestroviser that was developed to explore musician machine collaboration at the control signal level. The system functions by sampling a performers input, processing or reshaping this sampled input, and then repeatedly replaying it. The degree to which the sampled control signal is processed during replay is adjustable in real-time by the manipulation of a continuous finger slider function. The reshaping algorithm uses stochastic methods commonly used for MIDI note generation from a provided dataset. The reshaped signal therefore varies in an unpredictable manner. In this way the Gestroviser is a device to capture, reshape and replay an instrumental gesture. We describe the result of initial user testing of the system and discuss possible further development.",

The main point of this paper proposes that beyond the initial motivation produced by new technologies and their artistic potential, there are many profound artistic considerations that drive the development and design of a work in unique ways. Thus, in the case of the Wave Duet, the produced buoys were prompted by investigating the relationship between sonic objects and natural phenomena. As a result, the mappings, physical and sound designs directly reflect these issues. Finally, it is also suggested that during the course of development, unintended issues may emerge and further inform how the work is perceived in a broader sense.",

    "abstract": "Inclusive music activities for people with physical disabilities commonly emphasise facilitated processes, based both on constrained gestural capabilities, and on the simplicity of the available interfaces. Inclusive music processes employ consumer controllers, computer access tools and/or specialized digital musical instruments (DMIs). The first category reveals a design ethos identified by the authors as artefact multiplication – many sliders, buttons, dials and menu layers; the latter types offer ergonomic accessibility through artefact magnification. We present a prototype DMI that eschews artefact multiplication in pursuit of enhanced real time creative independence. We reconceptualise the universal click-drag interaction model via a single sensor type, which affords both binary and continuous performance control. Accessibility is optimized via a familiar interaction model and through customized ergonomics, but it is the mapping strategy that emphasizes transparency and sophistication in the hierarchical correspondences between the available gesture dimensions and expressive musical cues. Through a participatory and progressive methodology we identify an ostensibly simple targeting gesture rich in dynamic and reliable features: (1) contact location; (2) contact duration; (3) momentary force; (4) continuous force, and; (5) dyad orientation. These features are mapped onto dynamic musical cues, most notably via new mappings for vibrato and arpeggio execution.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of digital musical instruments is often opaque to the performer. Even when the relationship between action and sound is readily understandable, the internal hardware or software operations that create that relationship may be inaccessible to scrutiny or modification. This paper presents a new approach to digital instrument design which lets the performer alter and subvert the instrument’s internal operation through circuit-bending techniques. The approach uses low-latency feedback loops between software and analog hardware to expose the internal working of the instrument. Compared to the standard control voltage approach used on analog synths, alterations to the feedback loops produce distinctive and less predictable changes in behaviour with original artistic applications. This paper discusses the technical foundations of the approach, its roots in hacking and circuit bending, and case studies of its use in live performance with the D-Box hackable instrument.",

In this paper, a new algorithm is presented for the automatic recognition and evaluation of the various ornamentation techniques that are a central aspect of traditional Highland bagpipe music. The algorithm is evaluated alongside a previously published approach, and is shown to provide a significant improvement in performance. The ornament detection facility forms part of a complete hardware and software system for use in both tuition and solo practice situations, allowing details of ornamentation errors made by the player to be provided as visual and textual feedback. The system also incorporates new functionality for the identification and description of GHB fingering errors.",

    "abstract": "On a traditional keyboard, the actions required to play a consonant chord progression must be quite precise; accidentally strike a neighboring key, and a pleasant sonority is likely to become a jarring one. Inspired by the Tonnetz (a tonal diagram), we present a new layout of pitches defined using low-level harmonic notions. We demonstrate the potential of our system by mapping the random movements of fish in an aquarium to this layout. Qualitatively, we find that this captures the intuition behind mapping motion to sound. Similarly moving fish produce consonant chords, while fish moving in non-unison produce dissonant chords. We introduce an open source MATLAB library implementing these techniques, which can be used for sonifying multimodal streaming data.",

Caress is an octophonic miniature drum-set for the fingertips that employs eight acoustically isolated piezo-microphones, coupled with eight independent signal chains that excite a unique resonance model with audio from the piezos. The hardware is designed to be robust and quickly reproducible (parametric design and machine fabrication), while the software aims to be light-weight (low-CPU requirements) and portable (multiple platforms, multiple computing architectures). Above all, the instrument aims for the level of control intimacy and tactile expressivity achieved by traditional acoustic percussive instruments, while leveraging real-time software synthesis and control to expand the sonic palette. This instrument as well as this document are dedicated to the memory of the late David Wessel, pioneering composer, performer, researcher, mentor and all-around Yoda of electroacoustic music.",

Therapy sessions take the form of “musical ensembles” comprised of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), typically led by one or more certified music therapists. VESBALL had been developed in close consultation with therapists, clients, and other stakeholders, and had undergone several phases of trials at a music therapy facility over a period of 6 months. VESBALL has an advantage over other related work in terms of its robustness, ease of operation and setup (for clients and therapists), sound source integration, and low cost of production. The authors hope VESBALL would positively impact the conditions of individuals with ASD, and pave way for new research in custom-designed NIME for communities with specific therapeutic needs.",

GroupLoop users send their microphone stream to other participants while simultaneously controlling the mix of other users’ streams played through their speakers. Collaborations among users can yield complex feedback loops where feedback paths overlap and interact. Users are able to shape the feedback sounds in real-time by adjusting delay, EQ, and gain, as well as manipulating the acoustics of their portion of the audio feedback path. This paper outlines the basic principles underlying Grouploop, describes its design and feature-set, and discusses observations of GroupLoop in performances. It concludes with a look at future research and refinement.",

    "abstract": "Audio guides and (interactive) sound walks have existed for decades. Even smartphone games taking place in the real world are no longer a novelty. But due to the lack of a sufficient middleware which fulfills the requirements for creating this software genre, artists, game developers and institutions such as museums are forced to implement rather similar functionality over and over again. This paper describes the basic principles of Real World Audio (RWA), an extendable audio game engine for targeting smartphone operating systems, which rolls out all functionality for the generation of the above-mentioned software genres. It combines the ability for building location- based audio walks and -guides with the components necessary for game development. Using either the smartphone sensors or an external sensor board for head tracking and gesture recognition, RWA allows developers to create audio walks, audio adventures and audio role playing games (RPG) outside in the real world.",

    "abstract": "We describe research extending the interactive affordances of textual code fragments in creative coding environments. In particular we examine the potential of source code both to display the state of running processes and also to alter state using means other than traditional text editing. In contrast to previous research that has focused on the inclusion of additional interactive widgets inside or alongside text editors, our research adds a parsing stage to the runtime evaluation of code fragments and imparts additional interactive capabilities on the source code itself. After implementing various techniques in the creative coding environment Gibber, we evaluate our research through a survey on the various methods of visual feedback provided by our research. In addition to results quantifying preferences for certain techniques over others, we found near unanimous support among survey respondents for including similar techniques in other live coding environments.",

    "abstract": "The Modular Electro-Acoustic Robotic Instrument System (MEARIS) represents a new type of hybrid electroacoustic-electromechanical instrument model. Monochord-Aerophone Robotic Instrument Ensemble (MARIE), the first realization of a MEARIS, is a set of interconnected monochord and cylindrical aerophone robotic musical instruments created by Expressive Machines Musical Instruments (EMMI). MARIE comprises one or more matched pairs of Automatic Monochord Instruments (AMI) and Cylindrical Aerophone Robotic Instruments (CARI). Each AMI and CARI is a self-contained, independently operable robotic instrument with an acoustic element, a control system that enables automated manipulation of this element, and an audio system that includes input and output transducers coupled to the acoustic element. Each AMI-CARI pair can also operate as an interconnected hybrid instrument, allowing for effects that have heretofore been the domain of physical modeling technologies, such as a plucked air column or blown string. Since its creation, MARIE has toured widely, performed with dozens of human instrumentalists, and has been utilized by nine composers in the realization of more than twenty new musical works.",

The methods of machine learning and pattern recognition can be re-appropriated to serve as a generative principle. The goal is not classification but reaction from the system in an interactive and autonomous manner. This investigation looks at how machine learning algorithms fit generative purposes and what independent behaviours they enable. To this end we describe artistic and technical developments made to leverage existing machine learning algorithms as generative devices and discuss their relevance to the field of gestural interaction.",

Both a technical system and bespoke composition, Fields allows for a range of sonic diffusions to occur, and therefore has the potential to open up new paradigms for spatialised music and media performances. The project introduces how handheld technology used as a collective array of speakers controlled live by a centralized performer can create alternative types of participation within musical performance. Fields not only offers a new technological approach to sound diffusion, it also provides an alternative way for audiences to participate in live events, and opens up unique forms of engagement within sonic media contexts.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our current research in which we study the notion of performer engagement within the variance and diversities of the intentional activities of the performer in musical interaction. We introduce a user-test study with the aim to evaluate our system’s engagement prediction capability and to understand in detail the system’s response behaviour. The quantitative results indicate that our system recognises and monitors performer’s engagement successfully, although we found that the system’s response to maintain and deepen the performer’s engagement is perceived differently among participants. The results reported in this paper can be used to inform the design of interactive systems that enhance the quality of performer’s engagement in musical interaction with new interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Twitter has provided a social platform for everyone to enter the previously exclusive world of the internet, enriching this online social tapestry with cultural diversity and enabling revolutions. We believe this same tool can be used to also change the world of music creation. Thus we present MMODM, an online drum machine based on the Twitter streaming API, using tweets from around the world to create and perform musical sequences together in real time. Users anywhere can express 16-beat note sequences across 26 different instruments using plain text tweets on their favorite device, in real-time. Meanwhile, users on the site itself can use the graphical interface to locally DJ the rhythm, filters, and sequence blending. By harnessing this duo of website and Twitter network, MMODM enables a whole new scale of synchronous musical collaboration between users locally, remotely, across a wide variety of computing devices, and across a variety of cultures.",

    "abstract": "The motivation of this paper is to highlight the importance of visual representations for artists when modeling and simulating mass-interaction physical networks in the context of sound synthesis and musical composition. GENESIS is a musician-oriented software environment for sound synthesis and musical composition. However, despite this orientation, a substantial amount of effort has been put into building a rich variety of tools based on static or dynamic visual representations of models and of abstractions of their properties. After a quick survey of these tools, we will illustrate the significant role they play in the creative process involved when going from a musical idea and exploration to the production of a complete musical piece. To that aim, our analysis will rely on the work and practice of several artists having used GENESIS in various ways.",

A brief review of the literature discusses text-based generative systems, links between typing and playing percussion instruments and the use of typing gestures in contemporary performance practice. The paper then documents the author’s audio-visual system that is driven by the typing of text/lyrics in real-time. It is argued that the system promotes the sensation of liveness through clear, perceptible links between the performer’s gestures, the system’s audio outputs and the its visual outputs. The system also provides a novel approach to the use of generative techniques in the composition and live performance of songs. Future developments would include the use of dynamic text effects linked to sound generation and greater interaction between human performer and the visuals.",

    "abstract": "Computer music systems can interact with humans at different levels, including scores, phrases, notes, beats, and gestures. However, most current systems lack basic musicianship skills. As a consequence, the results of human-computer interaction are often far less musical than the interaction between human musicians. In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist, learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size, and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.",

The user first registers the lyrics of a song with the system before performance, and the system builds a probabilistic model that models the possible jumps within the lyrics. During performance, the user simultaneously inputs the lyrics of a song with the left hand using a vowel keyboard and the melodies with the right hand using a standard musical keyboard. Our system searches for a portion of the registered lyrics whose vowel sequence matches the current user input using the probabilistic model, and sends the matched lyrics to the singing voice synthesizer. The vowel input keys are mapped onto a standard musical keyboard, enabling experienced keyboard players to learn the system from a standard musical score. We examine the feasibility of the system through a series of evaluations and user studies.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) integrated with a musical instrument that adapts implicitly (with no extra effort from user) to users’ changing cognitive state during musical improvisation. Most previous musical BCI systems use either a mapping of brainwaves to create audio signals or use explicit brain signals to control some aspect of the music. Such systems do not take advantage of higher level semantically meaningful brain data which could be used in adaptive systems or without detracting from the attention of the user. We present a new type of real-time BCI that assists users in musical improvisation by adapting to users’ measured cognitive workload implicitly. Our system advances the state of the art in this area in three ways: 1) We demonstrate that cognitive workload can be classified in real-time while users play the piano using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. 2) We build a real-time, implicit system using this brain signal that musically adapts to what users are playing. 3) We demonstrate that users prefer this novel musical instrument over other conditions and report that they feel more creative.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports the goals, procedures and recent activities of the Smartphone Ensemble, an academic group of musicians and designers exploring mobile phones social mediation in musical contexts. The SE was created in the Design and Creation program at the Caldas University in Manizales, Colombia and includes six regular members. The group intends to enhance links among musicians, and between the musicians and their audience, by leveraging the network capabilities and mobility of smart phones, and exploring the expressivity of urban space. Through the creation of pieces and interventions that are related to urban experiences, the Smartphone Ensemble envisions alternatives to the standard musical performance space. In this regard, the performances intend to be urban interventions, not traditional concerts, they progress according to previously defined tours around the city that the group embarks while playing",

    "abstract": "An entertainment environment to enrich music listening experience is purposed. This environment is composed of 3 modules: a MIDI player, a music animation and a haptic module that translates the notes played by one instrument into a resemblant vibration. To create the haptic vibration, the notes’ relative pitch in the song are calculated, then these positions are mapped into the haptic signals’ amplitude and frequency. Also, the envelope of the haptic signal is modified, by using an ADSR filter, to have the same envelope as the audio signal. To evaluate the perceived cross-modal similarity between users, two experiments were performed. In both, the users used the complete entertainment environment to rank the similarity between 3 different haptic signals, with triangular, square and analogue envelopes and 4 different instruments in a classical song. The first experiment was performed with the purposed amplitude and frequency technique, while the second experiment was performed with constant frequency and amplitude. Results, show different envelope user preferences. The square and triangular envelopes were preferred in the first experiment, while only analogue envelopes were preferred in the second. This suggests that the users’ envelope perception was masked by the changes in amplitude and frequency.",

The tromba marina is a curious single stringed instrument with a rattling bridge, from which a trumpet-like timbre is produced. The physical instrument was constructed as a replica of one found in Musikmuseet in Frederiksberg. The replicated instrument was augmented with a pickup, speakers and digital signal processing to create a more reliable, approachable and appropriate instrument for interactive display in the museum.

    "abstract": "Despite increasingly accessible and user-friendly multi-channel compositional tools, many composers still choose stereo formats for their work, where the compositional process is allied to diffusion performance over a ‘classical’ loudspeaker orchestra. Although such orchestras remain common within UK institutions as well as in France, they are in decline in the rest of the world. In contrast, permanent, high-density loudspeaker arrays are on the rise, as is the practical application of 3-D audio technologies. Looking to the future, we need to reconcile the performance of historical and new stereo works, side-by-side native 3-D compositions. In anticipation of this growing need, we have designed and tested a prototype ‘Virtualmonium’. The Virtualmonium is an instrument for classical diffusion performance over an acousmonium emulated in higher-order Ambisonics. It allows composers to custom-design loudspeaker orchestra emulations for the performance of their works, rehearse and refine performances off-site, and perform classical repertoire alongside native 3-D formats in the same concert. This paper describes the technical design of the Virtualmonium, assesses the success of the prototype in some preliminary listening tests and concerts, and speculates how the instrument can further composition and performance practice.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how watching a live-sequenced electronic music performance, compared to merely hearing the music, contributes to spectators’ experiences of tension. We also explore the role of the performers’ effective and ancillary gestures in conveying tension, when they can be seen. To this end, we conducted an experiment where 30 participants heard, saw, or both heard and saw a live-sequenced techno music performance recording while they produced continuous judgments on their experience of tension. Eye tracking data was also recorded from participants who saw the visuals, to reveal aspects of the performance that influenced their tension judgments. We analysed the data to explore how auditory and visual components and the performer’s movements contribute to spectators’ experience of tension. Our results show that their perception of emotional intensity is consistent across hearing and sight, suggesting that gestures in live-sequencing can be a medium for expressive performance.",

    "abstract": "Most instruments traditionally used to teach music in early education, like xylophones or flutes, encumber children with the additional difficulty of an unfamiliar and unnatural interface. The most simple expressive interaction, that even the smallest children use in order to make music, is pounding at surfaces. Through the design of an instrument with a simple interface, like a drum, but which produces a melodic sound, children can be provided with an easy and intuitive means to produce consonance. This should then be further complemented with information from analysis and interpretation of childlike gestures and dance moves, reflecting their natural understanding of musical structure and motion. Based on these assumptions we propose a modular and reactive system for dynamic composition with accessible interfaces, divided into distinct plugins usable in a standard digital audio workstation. This paper describes our concept and how it can facilitate access to collaborative music making for small children. A first prototypical implementation has been designed and developed during the ongoing research project Drum-Dance-Music-Machine (DDMM), a cooperation with the local social welfare association AWO Hagen and the chair of musical education at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld.",

    "abstract": "We present an innovative sound spatialization and shaping interface, called SoundMorpheus, which allows the placement of sounds in space, as well as the altering of sound characteristics, via arm movements that resemble those of a conductor. The interface displays sounds (or their attributes) to the user, who reaches for them with one or both hands, grabs them, and gently or forcefully sends them around in space, in a 360$^{\\circ}$ circle. The system combines MIDI and traditional instruments with one or more myoelectric sensors. These components may be physically collocated or distributed in various locales connected via the Internet. This system also supports the performance of acousmatic and electronic music, enabling performances where the traditionally central mixing board, need not be touched at all (or minimally touched for calibration). Finally, the system may facilitate the recording of a visual score of a performance, which can be stored for later playback and additional manipulation. We present three projects that utilize SoundMorpheus and demonstrate its capabilities and potential.",

    "abstract": "This demonstration describes Tango, software for Computer-Human Improvisation developed for more than 25 years by Henning Berg. Tango listens to an improvising musician, analyses what it hears and plays musical responses which relate directly to the musical input. If the improviser in turn reacts to these answers, a musical loop between the human and the machine can emerge. The way input and reaction correlate and the predictability of Tango’s responses can be defined by the user via a setup of improvising environments, called Rooms. Real-time sampling with knowledge of the musical content behind the samples and Midi-handling are unified via Tango’s own monophonic audio-to-Midi, time stretching and pitch shifting algorithms. Both audio and Midi can be used by Tango’s modules (e.g. Listeners, Players, Modifiers, Metronomes or Harmony) for input and output. A flexible real time control system allows for internal and external remote control and scaling of most parameters. The free software for Windows7 with all necessary folders, English and German manuals, many example-Rooms and a few videos can be downloaded at www.henning-berg.de.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the roles of technical and musical familiarity in shaping audience response to digital musical instrument (DMI) performances. In an audience study conducted during an evening concert, we examined two primary questions: first, whether a deeper understanding of how a DMI works increases an audience’s enjoyment and interest in the performance; and second, given the same DMI and same performer, whether playing in a conventional (vernacular) versus an experimental musical style affects an audience’s response. We held a concert in which two DMI creator-performers each played two pieces in differing styles. Before the concert, each half the 64-person audience was given a technical explanation of one of the instruments. Results showed that receiving an explanation increased the reported understanding of that instrument, but had no effect on either the reported level of interest or enjoyment. On the other hand, performances in experimental versus conventional style on the same instrument received widely divergent audience responses. We discuss implications of these findings for DMI design.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an instance of what we call ‘curated research’, a concerted thinking, making and performance activity between two research teams with a dedicated interest in the creation of experimental musical instruments and the development of new performance practices. Our work builds theoretically upon critical work in philosophy, anthropology and aesthetics, and practically upon previous explorations of strategies for facilitating rapid, collaborative, publicly-oriented making in artistic settings. We explored an orientation to making which promoted the creation of a family of instruments and performance environments that were responses to the self-consciously provocative theme of ‘One Knob To Rule Them All’. A variety of design issues were explored including: mapping, physicality, the question of control in interface design, reductionist aesthetics and design strategies, and questions of gender and power in musical culture. We discuss not only the technologies which were made but also reflect on the value of such concerted, provocatively thematised, collective making activities for addressing foundational design issues. As such, our work is intended not just as a technical and practical contribution to NIME but also a reflective provocation into how we conduct research itself in a curated critical manner.",

However, the approach suffers from several limitations which have been shown to be particularly problematic when employed within musical contexts. This paper presents Leimu, a wrist mount that couples a Leap Motion optical sensor with an inertial measurement unit to combine the benefits of wearable and camera-based motion tracking. Leimu is designed, developed and then evaluated using discourse and statistical analysis methods. The results indicate that the Leimu is an effective interface for gestural music interaction and offers improved tracking precision over Leap Motion positioned on a table top.",

With Monad, we explore how various features of this environment in relation to game mechanics, network architecture, and audiovisual aesthetics can be used to mitigate problems inherent to networked musical performance, such as time delays, data loss, and reduced agency of users.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a package of modular tools developed for use with virtual reality peripherals to allow for music composition, performance and viewing in ‘real-time’ across networks within a spectralist paradigm. The central tool is SpectraScore, a Max/MSP abstraction for analysing audio signals and ranking the resultant partials according to their harmonic pitch class profiles. This data triggers the generation of objects in a virtual world based on the ‘topography’ of the source sound, which is experienced by network clients via Google Cardboard headsets. They use their movements to trigger audio in various microtonal tunings and incidentally generate scores. These scores are transmitted to performers who improvise music from this notation using Leap Motion Theremins, also in VR space. Finally, the performance is broadcast via a web audio stream, which can be heard by the composer-audience in the initial virtual world. The ‘real-time composers’ and performers are not required to have any prior knowledge of complex computer systems and interact either using head position tracking, or with a Oculus Rift DK2 and a Leap Motion Camera.",

We focus on two approaches, both of which are concerned with documenting, examining and reflecting on the real-world behaviours and experiences of people and artefacts involved in the creation of new works. The first approach is primarily based on reflections by an individual performer/developer (auto-ethnography) and the second on interviews and observations. The rationales for both approaches are presented along with findings from research which applied them in order to illustrate and explore the characteristics of both. Challenges, including the difficulty of balancing rigour and relevance and the risks of negatively impacting on creative practices are articulated, as are the potential benefits.",

Building on prior work with electromagnetic augmentation of acoustic instruments, we begin with a theory of operation model to describe the mechanical forces necessary to produce acoustic amplitude modulation synthesis. We then propose an implementation of our model as an instrumental prototype. The results illustrate that our acoustic amplitude modulation system produces controllable sideband components, and that synthesis generated from our corresponding numerical dynamic system model closely approximates the acoustic result of the physical system.",

Our work has been conducted in collaboration with the ATLAS Outreach team and is part of a broad vision to better harness real-time sensor data as a canvas for artistic expression.

    "abstract": "This project explores the potential for 3D modelling and printing to create customised flutes that can play music in a variety of microtonal scales. One of the challenges in the field of microtonality is that conventional musical instruments are inadequate for realising the abundance of theoretical tunings that musicians wish to investigate. This paper focuses on the development of two types of flutes, the recorder and transverse flute, with interchangeable mouthpieces. These flutes are designed to play subharmonic microtonal scales. The discussion provides an overview of the design and implementation process, including calculation methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing technologies, as well as an evaluation of some of the difficulties encountered. Results from our 3D printed flutes suggest that whilst further refinements are necessary in our designs, 3D modelling and printing techniques offer new and valuable methods for the design and production of customised musical instruments. The long term goal of this project is to create a system in which users can specify the tuning of their instrument to generate a 3D model and have it printed on demand.",

From sound and light shows, whereby light reacts to sound, or generated visuals are projected onto a screen behind the performer. However we asked the question what if we could convert sound to light and back again and control sound with light? Inspired by the huge acoustic of the Mimerlaven at Norberg festival we built a ‘light instrument’ that allowed us to interrupt and disrupt sound using light forming the basis of our piece ‘Interruption’.",

This system was developed for Emovere, an interdisciplinary piece for dance, biosignals, sound and visuals, yet it was conceived to accommodate interactive performances of different nature and of heterogeneous technical requirements, which we believe to represent a common underlying structure among these. The work presented in this document proposes a framework that takes care of the signal input/output stages, as well as storing and recalling presets and scenes, thus allowing the user to focus on the programming of interaction models and sound synthesis or sound processing. Results are presented with Emovere as an example case, discussing the advantages and further challenges that this framework offers for other performance scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Performance Without Borders and Embodied iSound, two sound installations performed at the 2016 Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival at Plymouth University. Sharing in common the use of smartphones to afford real-time audience participation, two bespoke distributed computer systems (Sherwell and Levinsky Music, respectively). Whilst the first one implements a cloud-based voting system, the second implements movement tracking and iBeacon-based indoor-positioning to control the choice of soundtracks, audio synthesis, and surround sound positioning, among other parameters. The general concepts of the installations, in particular design and interactive possibilities afforded by the computer systems are presented.",

    "abstract": "We present Focal, an eye-tracking musical expression controller which allows hands-free control over audio effects and synthesis parameters during peformance. A see-through head-mounted display projects virtual dials and switches into the visual field. The performer controls these with a single expression pedal, switching context by glancing at the object they wish to control. This simple interface allows for minimal physical disturbance to the instrumental musician, whilst enabling the control of many parameters otherwise only achievable with multiple foot pedalboards. We describe the development of the system, including the construction of the eye-tracking display, and the design of the musical interface. We also present a comparison of a performance between Focal and conventional controllers.",

    "abstract": "The author’s artistic practice as a composer and performer is transdisciplinary. The body as a vector associated with sound, gesture, video, physical space, and technological space, constitute the six founding elements. They give rise to works between music and dance, between musical theater and multimedia works leading to a new hybrid performative practice. These works are realized using a motion capture system by computer vision, SICMAP (Systéme Interactif de Captation du Mouvement en Art Performatif — Interactive Motion Capture System For The Performative Arts). In this paper, the author situates her artistic practice founded by the three pillars of transdisciplinary research methodology. The path taken by the performer-creator, leading to the conception of the SICMAP, is then explained through a reflection on the ‘dream instrument’. Followed by a technical description, the SICMAP is contextualized using theoretical models: the instrumental continuum and energy continuum, the ‘dream instrument’ and the typology of the instrumental gesture. Initiated by the SICMAP, these are then applied to a new paradigm the gesture-sound space and subsequently put into practice through the creation of the work From Infinity To Within.",

    "abstract": "NIMEs typically focus on novelty but the cost of novelty is often to ignore other non-functional requirements and concerns such as usability or security. Digital security has probably not been a concern for performers due to the duration of their performances and lack of disrespectful hackers, known as crackers, in attendance carrying the appropriate equipment and software necessary to hack a performance. Yet many modern NIMEs could be hacked from smart-phones in the audience. The lack of security hardening makes NIMEs an easy target — but a question arises: if hacking can interrupt or modify a performance couldn’t hacking itself also be performance? Thus would music hacking, live-hacking, be similar to live-coding? In this paper we discuss how NIMEs are in danger of being hacked, and yet how hacking can be an act of performance too.",

    "abstract": "Electronic pickup systems for acoustic instruments are often used in popular and contemporary music performances because they allow amplification and modification of a clean and direct signal. Strain gauge sensors on saxophone and clarinet reeds have been shown to be a useful tool to gain insight into tongue articulation during performance but also capture the reed vibrations. In our previous design, we used a procedure with epoxy adhesive to glue the strain gauge sensors to the flat side of the synthetic single reeds. The new design integrates the sensor inside a synthetic reed, respectively between layers of fibre polymer and wood. This allows an industrial production of sensor reeds. Sensor reeds open up new possibilities to pick up woodwind instruments and to analyse, to modify, and to amplify the signal. A signal-to-noise analysis of the signals from both designs showed that a sensor, glued to the outside of the reed, produced a cleaner signal.",

    "abstract": "Notation systems are used in almost all fields, especially for the communication and expression of ideas. This paper proposes and discusses a notation system for Gametrak-based computer music instruments. The notation system’s design is informed both by Western music notation and dance notation, as well as common mappings used in laptop orchestras. It is designed to be sound- agnostic, primarily instructing the performer in their motions. While the discussion of such a notation system may be particularly timely due to the growing commercially-available 3D motion tracking controllers, the notation system may prove especially useful in the context of Gametrak and laptop orchestra, for which score-based representation can help clarify performer interaction and serve as a teaching tool in documenting prior work.",

This paper evaluates the use of audio-rate control signals for sound synthesis, and discussing approaches to de-interleaving, synchronization, and mapping. The paper also outlines a number of ways of extending the expressivity of such a control interface by coupling this with another 2D multi-parametric nodes interface and audio-rate 2D table lookup. The paper proceeds to review methods of navigating multi-parameter sets via interpolation and transformation. Some case studies are finally discussed in the paper. The author has used this method to control complex sound synthesis processes that require control data for more that a thousand parameters.",

The few controllers that allow hand-drumming techniques also invariably conform to region-based triggering design, or, in trade-off for expressivity, end up excluding hardware connectivity options that are vital to the context of the modern electronic rhythm producer. The HandSolo is a timbre-based drum controller that allows the use of natural, hand-drumming strokes, whilst offering the same end-goal functionality that percussion controller users have come to expect over the past decade.",

The system affords automated positioning of a loudspeaker in real-time in order to manipulate the spatial qualities of electronic music. The paper gives a technical overview of how the system’s hardware and software were developed and the design criteria and methodology. There is discussion of the unique features of the speaker.motion spatialisation system and the methods of user interaction, as well as a look at the creative possibilities that the loudspeakers afford. The creative affordances are explored through the case study of two new pieces written for the speaker.motion system. It is hoped that the speaker.motion system will afford composers and performers with a new range of spatial aesthetics to use in spatial performances, and encourage exploration of the acoustic properties of physical performance and installation spaces in electronic music.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a generative drumming agent built from the results of an extensive survey carried out with electronic music producers, in two phases. Following the techniques of user-centered interaction design, an international group of beat producers was reviewed on the possibility of using AI algorithms to help them in the beat production workflow. The analyzed results of these tests were used as design requirements for constructing a system that would indeed perform some tasks alongside the producer. The first results of this working prototype are presented with a description of the system. The prototype is a stylistic drum generator that creates new rhythmic patterns after being trained with a collection of drum tracks. Further stages of development and potential algorithms are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents two new musical robot systems and an accompanying driver electronics array. These systems are designed to allow for modular extensibility and ease of use with different instrument systems. The first system discussed is MalletOTon, a mechatronic mallet instrument player that may be re-configured to play a number of different instruments. Secondly, the Modulet mechatronic noisemakers are presented. These instruments are discrete modules that may be installed throughout a space in a wide variety of configurations. In addition to presenting the aforementioned new instruments, the Novalis system is shown. Novalis is an open-ended driver system for mechatronic instruments, designed to afford rapid deployment and modularity. Where prior mechatronic instruments are often purpose-built, the robots and robot electronics presented in this paper may be re-deployed in a wide-ranging, diverse manner. Taken as a whole, the design practices discussed in this paper go toward establishing a paradigm of modular and extensible mechatronic instrument development.",

    "abstract": "The following paper documents the prototype of a musical door that interactively plays sounds, melodies, and sound textures when in use. We took the natural interactions people have with doors—grabbing and turning the knob and pushing and puling motions—and turned them into musical activities. The idea behind this project comes from the fact that the activity of using a door is almost always accompanied by a sound that is generally ignored by the user. We believe that this sound can be considered musically rich and expressive because each door has specific sound characteristics and each person makes it sound slightly different. By augmenting the door to create an unexpected sound, this project encourages us to listen to our daily lives with a musician’s critical ear, and reminds us of the musicality of our everyday activities.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an ongoing project for augmenting acoustic instruments with active acoustics. Active acoustics are defined as audio-rate vibration driven into the instruments physical structure, inducing air-borne sound output. The instrument’s acoustic sound is thus doubled by an electronic soundscape radiating from the same source. The article is centered on a case study on two guitars, one with hexaphonic sound capture and the other with monophonic pickup. The article discusses the design, implementation, acoustics, sound capture and processing of an active acoustic instrument, as well as gestural control using the Leap Motion sensor. Extensions towards other instruments are presented, in connection with related artistic projects and ‘electronic chamber music’ aesthetics.",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests a novel form of audiovisual performance- live writing- that transforms creative writing into a real-time performing art. The process of typing a poem on the fly is captured and augmented to create an audiovisual performance that establishes natural links among the components of typing gestures, the poem being written on the fly, and audiovisual artifacts. Live writing draws upon ideas from the tradition of live coding in which the process of programming is revealed to the audience in real-time. This paper discusses the motivation behind the idea, interaction schemes and a performance interface for such a performance practice. Our live writing performance system is enabled by a custom text editor, writing-sound mapping strategies of our choice, a poem-sonification, and temporal typography. We describe two live writing performances that take different approaches as they vary the degree of composition and improvisation in writing.",

    "abstract": "Digitalization has enabled material decoupling of sound from the physical devices traditionally used to conceive it. This paper reports an artistic exploration of novel mappings between everyday objects and digital sound. The Wheel Quintet—a novel musical instrument comprising four bicycle wheels and a skateboard—was created using off-the-shelf components and visual programming in Max/MSP. The use of everyday objects sought to enable people to quickly master the instrument, regardless of their musical backgrounds, and collectively create polytempic musical textures in a participatory art context. Applying an action research approach, the paper examines in detail two key cycles of planning, action, and analysis related to the instrument, involving an interactive museum exhibition open to the public and a concert hall performance conducted by an animated music notation system. Drawing on insights from the study, the paper contributes new knowledge concerning the creation and use of novel interfaces for music composition and performance enabled by digitalization.",

    "abstract": "We organised an elven day intense course in materiality for musical expressions to explore underlying principles of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) in higher educa- tion. We grounded the course in different aspects of ma- teriality and gathered interdisciplinary student teams from three Nordic universities. Electronic music instrument mak- ers participated in providing the course. In eleven days the students designed and built interfaces for musical expres- sions, composed a piece, and performed at the Norberg elec- tronic music festival. The students explored the relationship between technology and possible musical expression with a strong connection to culture and place. The emphasis on performance provided closure and motivated teams to move forward in their design and artistic processes. On the basis of the course we discuss an interdisciplinary NIME course syllabus, and we infer that it benefits from grounding in materiality and in the place with a strong reference to culture.",

    "abstract": "Musical robots provide artists and musicians with the ability to realise complex new musical ideas in real acoustic space. However, most musical robots are created with open-loop control systems, many of which require time consuming calibration and do not reach the level of reliability of other electronic musical instruments such as synthesizers. This paper outlines the construction of a new robotic musical instrument, the Closed-Loop Robotic Glockenspiel, and discusses the improved robustness, usability and expressive capabilities that closed-loop control systems and embedded musical information retrieval processes can afford robotic musical instruments. The hardware design of the instrument is described along with the firmware of the embedded MIR system. The result is a new desktop robotic musical instrument that is capable of continuous unaided re-calibration, is as simple to use as more traditional hardware electronic sound-sources and provides musicians with new expressive capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The majority of musical robotics performances, projects and installations utilise microcontroller hardware to digitally interface the robotic instruments with sequencer software and other musical controllers, often via a personal computer. While in many ways digital interfacing offers considerable power and flexibility, digital protocols, equipment and audio workstations often tend to suggest particular music-making work-flows and have resolution and timing limitations. This paper describes the creation of a hardware interface that allows direct communication between analogue synthesizer equipment and simple robotic musical instruments entirely in the analogue domain without the use of computers, microcontrollers or software of any kind. Several newly created musical robots of various designs are presented, together with a custom built hardware interface with circuitry that enables analogue synthesizers to interface with the robots without any digital intermediary. This enables novel methods of musical expression, creates new music-making work-flows for composing and improvising with musical robots and takes advantage of the low latency and infinite resolution of analogue circuits.",

    "abstract": "We present a composition framework that facilitates novel musical mappings for large-scale distributed networks of environmental sensors. A library of C-externals called ChainFlow for the graphical programming language Max/MSP that provides an interface to real-time and historical data for large sensor deployments was designed and implemented. This library along with spatialized audio techniques were used to create immersive musical compositions which can be presented on their own or complemented by a graphical 3D virtual world. Musical works driven by a sensor network deployed in a wetland restoration project called Tidmarsh are presented as case studies in augmented presence through musical mapping.",

    "abstract": "The importance of low and consistent latency in interactive music systems is well-established. So how do commonly-used tools for creating digital musical instruments and other tangible interfaces perform in terms of latency from user action to sound output? This paper examines several common configurations where a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino) or wireless device communicates with computer-based sound generator (e.g. Max/MSP, Pd). We find that, perhaps surprisingly, almost none of the tested configurations meet generally-accepted guidelines for latency and jitter. To address this limitation, the paper presents a new embedded platform, Bela, which is capable of complex audio and sensor processing at submillisecond latency.",

    "abstract": "The ‘Laptop Accordion’ co-opts the commodity laptop computer to craft an expressive, whimsical accordion-like instrument. It utilizes the opening and closing of the laptop screen as a physical metaphor for accordion bellows, and the laptop keyboard as musical buttonboard. Motion is tracked using the laptop camera via optical flow and mapped to continuous control over dynamics, while the sound is generated in real-time. The instrument uses both skeuomorphic and abstract onscreen graphics which further reference the core mechanics of ‘squeezebox’ instruments. The laptop accordion provides several game modes, while overall offering an unconventional aesthetic experience in music making.",

    "abstract": "We present an application XronoMorph for the algorithmic generation of rhythms in the context of creative composition and performance, and of musical analysis and education. XronoMorph makes use of visual and geometrical conceptualizations of rhythms, and allows the user to smoothly morph between rhythms. Sonification of the user generated geometrical constructs is possible using a built-in sampler, VST and AU plugins, or standalone synthesizers via MIDI. The algorithms are based on two underlying mathematical principles: perfect balance and well-formedness, both of which can be derived from coefficients of the discrete Fourier transform of the rhythm. The mathematical background, musical implications, and their implementation in the software are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This is a report of a novel tactile musical instrument. This instrument is called Multi Rubbing Tactile Instrument (MRTI2015), using ten pieces of PAW sensor produced by the RT corporation. Previous research was focused on untouchable instruments, but this approach is fully tactile—rub and touch. The ten PAW sensors are assigned on the surface of the egg-like plastic case to fit the ten fingers grasping the instrument. The controller is mbed (NucleoF401RE), and it communicates with the host PC via high speed serial (115200bps) by an MIDI-like protocol. Inside the egg- like plastic case, this instrument has eight blue-LEDs which are controlled by the host in order to display the grasping nuances. The prototype of this instrument contains realtime visualizing system with chaotic graphics by Open-GL. I will report on the principle of the sensor, and details about realizing the new system.",

The interface provides a simple way of interacting: the only input required involves drawing two waveforms, meaning that users can easily produce various sounds intuitively without the need for complex manipulation. The application’s interface comprises of an interchangeable ribbon and keyboard feature, plus two panels where users can edit waveforms, allowing users to make sounds. This simple approach to the interface means that it is easy for users to understand the relationship between a waveform and the sound that it produces.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a development of the ubiquitous computer keyboard to capture velocity and other continuous musical properties, in order to support more expressive interaction with music software. Building on existing ‘virtual piano’ utilities, the device is designed to provide a richer mechanism for note entry within predominantly non-realtime editing tasks, in applications where keyboard interaction is a central component of the user experience (score editors, sequencers, DAWs, trackers, live coding), and in which users draw on virtuosities in both music and computing. In the keyboard, additional hardware combines existing scan code (key press) data with accelerometer readings to create a secondary USB device, using the same cable but visible to software as a separate USB MIDI device aside existing USB HID functionality. This paper presents and evaluates an initial prototype, developed using an Arduino board and inexpensive sensors, and discusses design considerations and test findings in musical applications, drawing on user studies of keyboard-mediated music interaction. Without challenging more established (and expensive) performance devices; significant benefits are demonstrated in notation-mediated interaction, where the user’s focus rests with software.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes how a classical instrument, the clarinet, can be extended with modern technology to create a new and easy to use augmented instrument. The paper describes the design process, technical details and how a musician can use the instrument. The clarinet bell is extended with sensor technology in order to improve the ways the clarinet is traditionally played and improve the performing artist’s musical and performative expressions. New ways of performing music with a clarinet also opens up for novel ways of composing musical pieces. The design is iterated in two versions with improved hardware and form factor where everything is packaged into the clarinet bell. The clarinet uses electronics that wirelessly sends sensor data to a computer that processes a live audio feed via the software MAX 7 and plays it back via loudspeakers on the stage. The extended clarinet provides several ways of transforming audio and also adds several ways of making performances more visually interesting. It is shown that this way of using sensor technology in a traditional musical instrument adds new dimensions to the performance and allows creative persons to express themselves in new ways as well as giving the audience an improved experience.",

We introduce a graph-based model enabling novel visualisation and manipulation of new patterns that mimics the rhythmic and timbral character of an existing target seed pattern using a separate database of palette sounds. Our approach is de- scribed, reporting on those features that may be useful in describing units of sound related to rhythm and how they might then be projected into two-dimensional space for visualisation using reduction techniques and clustering. We conclude the paper with our qualitative appraisal of using the interface and outline scope for future work.",

We propose two approaches to performing with residUUm and discuss the methods utilized to fulfill the promise of audience-visible interaction: mapping and performance strategies applied to express audiovisual interactions with multilayered sound-image relationships. The system received positive feedback from 34 audience participants on aspects such as aesthetics and audiovisual integration, and we identified further design challenges around performance clarity and strategy. We discuss residUUm’s development objectives, modes of interaction and the impact of an audience-visible interface on the performer and observer.",

    "abstract": "Video games and music have influenced each other since the beginning of the consumer video game era. In particular the chiptune genre of music uses sounds from 8-bit video games; these sounds have even found their way into contemporary popular music. However, in this genre, game sounds are arranged using conventional musical interfaces, meaning the games themselves (their algorithms, design and interactivity) play no role in the creation of the music.This paper describes a new way of creating music with 8-bit games, by reverse engineering and augmenting them with run-time scripts. A new API, Emstrument, is presented which allows these scripts to send MIDI to music production software. The end result is game-derived musical interfaces any computer musician can use with their existing workflow. This enhances prior work in repurposing games as musical interfaces by allowing musicians to use the original games instead of having to build new versions with added musical capabilities.Several examples of both new musical instruments and dynamic interactive musical compositions using Emstrument are presented, using iconic games from the 8-bit era.",

    "abstract": "PORTAL is an interactive performance tool that uses a laser projector to visualize computer-generated audio signals. In this paper, we first offer an overview of earlier work on audiovisual and laser art that inspired the current project. We then discuss our own implementation, focusing not only on the technical issues related to the use of a laser projector in an artistic context, but also on the aesthetic considerations in dealing with the translation of sounds into visuals, and vice versa. We provide detailed descriptions of our hardware implementation, our software system, and its desktop and mobile interfaces, which are made available online. Finally, we offer the results of a user study we conducted in the form of an interactive online survey on audience perception of the relationship between analogous sounds and visuals, which was explored as part of our performance practice.",

    "abstract": "The question of sound as an experience of now, as a conduit to the quality of our belonging to the present, is challenging. Yet it is a crucial issue in discussions about ecological listening. I have come to think of sound as a viscous material, a vibrating field of energy that has texture and density and a physicality that is unlike most other media.Now suggests a desire of becoming present in the resonating sound field of our immediate environment. The energy in the field constantly modulates and drifts. I draw on voices and forces from the natural environment, humans and machines. The work seeks to draw the listeners into an inner space in which they can be both present and aware of their sonic environment and become immersed in it. Now is partly inspired by Samuel Beckett’s novel Watt, specifically Watt’s mysterious journey into to the unknown.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the design of a Minimally Invasive Gesture Sensing Interface (MIGSI) for trumpet. The interface attaches effortlessly to any B-flat or C trumpet and requires no permanent modifications to the host-instrument. It was designed first and foremost with accessibility in mind an approach that is uncommon in augmented instrument design and seeks to strike a balance between minimal design and robust control. MIGSI uses sensor technology to capture gestural data such as valve displacement, hand tension, and instrument position, to offer extended control and expressivity to trumpet players. Several streams of continuous data are transmitted wirelessly from MIGSI to the receiving computer, where MIGSI Mapping application (a simple graphical user interface) parses the incoming data into individually accessible variables. It is our hope that MIGSI will be adopted by trumpet players and composers, and that over time a new body of repertoire for the augmented trumpet will emerge.",

Closed circuit sensors, moving wooden parts and Piezo microphones are discussed in the design phase alongside background and musical implementation concepts. Electronics and nature converge in this instrument harmoniously referencing our changing world and environment. When engaging with the sonic sculpture silent objects become audible and rest-wood is venerated. It is revealed to the musician interacting with Driftwood that our actions intervene directly with issues relating to sustainability and the amount of value we place on the world we live in. Every scrap of wood was once a tree, Driftwood reminds us of this in a multi-sensory playing experience. The Driftwood proposes a reinterpretation of the process of music creation, awareness and expression.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of breaking the barrier between deaf and hearing people when it comes to the subject of making music. Suggestions on how deaf and hearing people can collaborate in creating music together, are presented. The conducted research will focus on deaf people with a general interest in music as well as hearing musicians as target groups. Through reviewing different related research areas, it is found that visualization of sound along with a haptic feedback can help deaf people interpret and interact with music. With this in mind, three variations of a collaborative user interface are presented, in which deaf and hearing people are meant to collaborate in creating short beats and melody sequences. Through evaluating the three prototypes, with two deaf people and two hearing musicians, it is found that the target groups can collaborate to some extent in creating beats. However, in order for the target groups to create melodic sequences together in a satisfactory manner, more detailed visualization and distributed haptic output is necessary, mostly due to the fact that the deaf test participants struggle in distinguishing between higher pitch and timbre.",

    "abstract": "Despite the near ubiquitous availability of interfaces for spatial interaction, standard audio spatialisation technology makes very little use of it. In fact, we find that audio technology often impedes spatial interaction: In the workshop on music, space and interaction we thus developed the idea of a real-time panning whereby a moving sound source is reproduced as a virtual source on a panning trajectory. We define a series of application scenarios where we describe in detail what functionality is required to inform an implementation. In our earlier work we showed that Acoustic Localisation (AL) potentially can provide a pervasive technique for spatially interactive audio applications. Playing through the application scenarios with AL in mind provides interesting approaches. For one scenario we show an example implementation as proof of concept.",

The work was conducted both in and with the public, allowing participants to inform the creative decisions made throughout the project as well as experiencing the building of the artworks. Within this essay we report on our process, presentation and offer alternative methods for collecting material and presenting representations of space.

    "abstract": "Many commercial software applications for timbre creation and manipulation feature an engineering-focused, parametric layout. This paper argues the case for a perceptually motivated approach to interface design in such tools. ‘Perceptually motivated’ in this context refers to the use of common semantic timbre descriptors to influence the digital representation of timbre. A review is given of existing research into semantic descriptors of timbre, as well as corresponding acoustic features of timbre. Discussion is also given on existing interface design techniques. The perceptually motivated approach to interface design is demonstrated using an example system, which makes use of perceptually relevant mappings from acoustic timbre features to semantic timbre descriptors and visualises sounds as physical objects.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present the new development of a semi-autonomous response module for the NOISA system. NOISA is an interactive music system that predicts performer’s engagement levels, learns from the performer, decides what to do and does it at the right moment. As an improvement for the above, we implemented real-time adaptive features that respond to a detailed monitoring of the performer’s engagement and to overall sonic space, while evaluating the impact of its actions. Through these new features, the response module produces meaningful and non-intrusive counter actions, attempting to deepen and maintain the performer’s engagement in musical interaction. In a formative study we compared our designed response module against a random control system of events, in which the former performed consistently better than the latter.",

    "abstract": "StrumBot is a novel standalone six stringed robotic guitar consisting of mechanisms designed to enable musical expressivity and minimise acoustic noise. It is desirable for less than 60 dBA of noise at 1 m to be emitted to allow StrumBot to play in intimate venues such as cafés or restaurants without loud motor noises detracting from the musical experience.StrumBot improves upon previous RMI’s by allowing additional expressive opportunities for a composer to utilise. StrumBot can perform slides, vibrato, muting techniques, pitch bends, pluck power variances, timbre control, complex chords and fast strumming patterns.A MIDI input allows commercial or custom controllers to operate StrumBot. Novel note allocation algorithms were created to allow a single MIDI stream of notes to be allocated across the six guitar strings.Latency measurements from MIDI input to string pluck are as low as 40 ms for a best case scenario strum, allowing StrumBot to accompany a live musician with minimal audible delay.A relay based loop switcher is incorporated, allowing StrumBot to activate standard commercial guitar pedals based on a MIDI instruction.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in ‘unlocking’ the motor skills of expert musicians. Motivated by this need, the main objective of this paper is to present a new way of modeling expressive gesture variations in musical performance. For this purpose, the 3D gesture recognition engine ‘x2Gesture’ (eXpert eXpressive Gesture) has been developed, inspired by the Gesture Variation Follower, which is initially designed and developed at IRCAM in Paris and then extended at Goldsmiths College in London. x2Gesture supports both learning of musical gestures and live performing, through gesture sonification, as a unified user experience. The deeper understanding of the expressive gestural variations permits to define the confidence bounds of the expert’s gestures, which are used during the decoding phase of the recognition. The first experiments show promising results in terms of recognition accuracy and temporal alignment between template and performed gesture, which leads to a better fluidity and immediacy and thus gesture sonification.",

The use of real-world metaphors as a strategy for increasing audience engagement is also discussed.The composition and system Church Belles is presented, analyzed and evaluated in terms of its architecture, how it relates to existing studies of musician-machine creative interaction and how the use of a real-world metaphor can promote audience perceptions of liveness.

The designs of several popular commercial mobile music instruments are discussed and compared, along with the different ways they integrate musical information and game-like elements. In particular, issues of designing goals, rules, and interactions are balanced with articulating expressiveness. These experiences aim to invite and engage users with game design while maintaining and encouraging open-ended musical expression and exploration. A set of observations is derived, leading to a broader design motivation and philosophy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an empirical evaluation of a digital music instrument (DMI) for electroacoustic vocal performance, the Tibetan Singing Prayer Wheel (TSPW). Specifically, we study audience preference for the way it maps horizontal spinning gestures to vocal processing parameters. We filmed six songs with the singer using the TSPW, and created two alternative soundtracks for each song: one desynchronized, and one with the mapping inverted. Participants viewed all six songs with either the original or desynchronized soundtrack (Experiment 1), or either the original or inverted-mapping soundtrack (Experiment 2). Participants were asked several questions via questionnaire after each song. Overall, they reported higher engagement and preference for the original versions, suggesting that audiences of the TSPW prefer more highly synchronized performances, as well as more intuitive mappings, though level of perceived expression of the performer only significantly differed in Experiment 1. Further, we believe that our experimental methods contribute to how DMIs can be evaluated from the audience’s (a recently noted under- represented stakeholder) perspective.",

These cover a range of interaction paradigms to generate ambient textures, polyrhythms, and melodies. This paper first presents existing work from which we drew interactions and metaphors for our designs. We then introduce each of our instruments and the back-end software we used to prototype them.

Audience members can vote for pre-determined musical attributes using a smartphone-friendly and cross-platform web application. The system gathers audience members’ votes and provide feedback through visualisations that can be tailored for specific needs. In order to support multiple performers and large audiences, automatic audience-to-performer groupings are handled by the application. The framework was applied to support live interactive musical improvisations where creative roles are shared amongst audience and performers (Open Symphony). Qualitative analyses of user surveys highlighted very positive feedback related to themes such as engagement and creativity and also identified further design challenges around audience sense of control and latency.",

    "abstract": "The Feedback Cello is a new electroacoustic actuated instrument in which feedback can be induced independently on each string. Built from retro-fitted acoustic cellos, the signals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string are passed to a speaker built into the back of the instrument and to transducers clamped in varying places across the instrument body. Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations. Future developments and planned investigations are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Learning to play the transverse flute is not an easy task, at least not for everyone. Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate and thereby produce sound. In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet. For a beginner, this can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lips position. This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible and measurable. The augmented flute shows information about the area covered by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it shows graphically the air jet direction. Additionally, the augmented flute provides directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced flutists.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the idea of using virtual textural terrains as a means of generating haptic profiles for force-feedback controllers. This approach breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to transduce gesture into sonic output. We outline a method for generating multimodal terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain. We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.",

    "abstract": "Musicians, audio engineers and producers often make use of common timbral adjectives to describe musical signals and transformations. However, the subjective nature of these terms, and the variability with respect to musical context often leads to inconsistencies in their definition. In this study, a model is proposed for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75",

    "abstract": "Biostomp is a new musical interface that relies on the use mechanomyography (MMG) as a biocontrol mechanism in live performance situations. Designed in the form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer’s muscle movements into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals. The primary goal in designing Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract for Biostomp can be viewed at vimeo.com/biostomp/video.",

    "abstract": "An application for ballet training is presented that monitors the posture position (straightness of the spine and rotation of the pelvis) deviation from the ideal position in real-time. The human skeletal data is acquired through a Microsoft Kinect v2. The movement of the student is mirrored through an abstract skeletal figure and instructions are provided through a virtual teacher. Posture deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual feedback modality with no feedback leads to an increase in posture accuracy (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.047). Reaction card feedback and expert interviews indicate that the feedback is considered fun and useful for training independently from the teacher.",

    "abstract": "Musical instruments and musical user interfaces provide rich input and feedback through mostly tangible interactions, resulting in complex behavior. However, publications of novel interfaces often lack the required detail due to the complexity or the focus on a specific part of the interfaces and absence of a specific template or structure to describe these interactions. Drawing on and synthesizing models from interaction design and music making we propose a way for modeling musical interfaces by providing a scheme and visual language to describe, design, analyze, and compare interfaces for music making. To illustrate its capabilities we apply the proposed model to a range of assistive musical instruments, which often draw on multi-modal in- and output, resulting in complex designs and descriptions thereof.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between music improvisers is studied in the context of piano duets, where one improviser embellishes a melody, and the other plays a chordal accompaniment with great freedom. We created an automated accompaniment player that learns to play from example performances. Accompaniments are constructed by selecting and concatenating one-measure score units from actual performances. An important innovation is the ability to learn how the improvised accompaniment should respond to variations in the melody performance, using tempo and embellishment complexity as features, resulting in a truly interactive performance within a conventional musical framework. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations, showing that the learned improviser performs more interactive, musical, and human-like accompaniment compared with the less responsive, rule-based baseline algorithm.",

    "abstract": "A new hybrid approach to digital keyboard playing is presented, where the actual acoustic sounds from a digital keyboard are captured with contact microphones and applied as excitation signals to a digital model of a prepared piano, i.e., an extended wave-guide model of strings with the possibility of stopping and muting the strings at arbitrary positions. The parameters of the string model are controlled through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping. The instrument is evaluated from a performing musician’s perspective, and emerging playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument, yet with new kinds of control. The contributions are two-fold. First, the use of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of \"inside piano\" playing, using multitouch keyboard data, allows for performance techniques going far beyond conventional keyboard playing.",

Different strategies of mapping were developed and discussed within the NIME community to improve musical expression in live performances. This paper discusses an interface focussed instrument design approach, which starts from the physical controller and its functionality. From this definition, the required, underlying software instrument is derived. A proof of concept is implemented as a framework for effect instruments. This framework comprises a library of real-time effects for Csound, a proposition for a JSON-based mapping format, and a mapping-to-instrument converter that outputs Csound instrument files.

    "abstract": "Reflexive Looper (RL) is a live-looping system which allows a solo musician to incarnate the different roles of a whole rhythm section by looping rhythms, chord progressions, bassline and more. The loop pedal, is still the most used device for those types of performances, accounting for many of the cover songs performances on youtube, but not all kinds of song apply. Unlike a common loop pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization. In its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage, we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints, the new RL deals with pop music and has been already used in several in live concert situations.",

    "abstract": "Physical modelling is a sophisticated synthesis technique, often used in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.",

    "abstract": "The recent resurgence of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies provide new platforms for augmenting traditional music instruments. Instrument augmentation is a common approach for designing new interfaces for musical expression, as shown through hyperinstrument research. New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes. The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment. The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer’s hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.",

In particular, we are concerned with how to provide accessible means of controlling spatialization and timbral shaping in an integrated manner through the collection of performance data from various modalities from an electric guitar with a multichannel audio output. This paper will focus specifically on the combination of pitch data treated within tonal models and the detection of physical performance gestures using timbral feature extraction algorithms. We discuss how these tracked gestures may be connected to concepts and dynamic relationships from embodied cognition, expanding on performative models for pitch and timbre spaces. Finally, we explore how these ideas support connections between sonic, formal and performative dimensions. This includes instrumental technique detection scenes and mapping strategies aimed at bridging music performance gestures across physical and conceptual planes.",

    "abstract": "The ideation, conception and implementation of new musical interfaces and instruments provide more than the mere construction of digital objects. As physical and digital assemblages, interfaces also act as traces of the authoring entities that created them. Their intentions, likes, dislikes, and ultimate determinations of what is creatively useful all get embedded into the available choices of the interface. In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined.",

    "abstract": "One of the reasons of why some musical instruments more successfully continue their evolution and actively take part in the history of music is partially attributed to the existing compositions made specifically for them, pieces that remain and are still played over a long period of time. This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.",

    "abstract": "Gestural interfaces, which make use of physiological signals, hand / body postures or movements, have become widespread for musical expression. While they may increase the transparency and expressiveness of instruments, they may also result in limited agency, for musicians as well as for spectators. This problem becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces. Most existing solutions to these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small screens). Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual objects. Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces. We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing gestural musical instruments.",

    "abstract": "MM-RT (material and magnet - rhythm and timbre) is a tabletop musical instrument equipped with electromagnetic actuators to offer a new paradigm of musical expression and exploration. After expanding on prior work with electromagnetic instrument actuation and tabletop musical interfaces, the paper explains why and how MM-RT, through its physicality and ergonomics, has been designed specifically for musical wonderers: people who want to know more about music in installation, concert, and everyday contexts. Those wonderers aspire to interpret and explore music rather than focussing on a technically correct realization of music. Informed by this vision, we then describe the design and technical implementation of this tabletop musical instrument. The paper concludes with discussions about future works and how to trigger musical wonderers’ sonic curiosity to encounter, explore, invent, and organize sounds for music creation using a musical instrument like MM-RT.",

    "abstract": "Every new edition of NIME brings dozens of new DMIs and the feeling that only a few of them will eventually break through. Previous work tried to address this issue with a deductive approach by formulating design frameworks; we addressed this issue with a inductive approach by elaborating on successes and failures of previous DMIs. We contacted 97 DMI makers that presented a new instrument at five successive editions of NIME (2010-2014); 70 answered. They were asked to indicate the original motivation for designing the DMI and to present information about its uptake. Results confirmed that most of the instruments have difficulties establishing themselves. Also, they were asked to reflect on the specific factors that facilitated and those that hindered instrument longevity. By grounding these reflections on existing reserach on NIME and HCI, we propose a series of design considerations for future DMIs.",

    "abstract": "Performative control of voice is the process of real-time speech synthesis or modification by the means of hands or feet gestures. Vokinesis, a system for real-time rhythm and pitch modification and control of singing is presented. Pitch and vocal effort are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The concept of Syllabic Control Points (SCP) is introduced for timing and rhythm control. A chain of phonetic syllables have two types of temporal phases : the steady phases, which correspond to the vocalic nuclei, and the transient phases, which correspond to the attacks and/or codas. Thus, syllabic rhythm control methods need transient and steady phases control points, corresponding to the ancient concept of the arsis and thesis is prosodic theory. SCP allow for accurate control of articulation, using hand or feet. In the <i>Tap mode</i>, SCP are triggered by pressing and releasing a control button. In the <i>Fader mode</i>, continuous variation of the SCP sequencing rate is controlled with expression pedals. Vokinesis has been tested successfully in musical performances, using both syllabic rhythm control modes. This system opens new musical possibilities, and can be extended to other types of sounds beyond voice.",

    "abstract": "The didgeridoo is a wind instrument composed of a single large tube often used as drone instrument for backing up the mids and lows of an ensemble. A didgeridoo is played by buzzing the lips and blowing air into the didgeridoo. To play a didgeridoo continously one can employ circular breathing but the volume of air required poses a real challenge to novice players. In this paper we replace the expense of circular breathing and lip buzzing with electronic excitation, thus creating an electro-acoustic didgeridoo or electronic didgeridoo. Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers and controllable from a computer. To properly drive the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the need for circular breathing.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a knowledge-based, data-driven method for using data describing action-sound couplings collected from a group of people to generate multiple complex mappings between the performance movements of a musician and sound synthesis. This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters. A series of sound stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument they are given. Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus. The dataset created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define mappings for real-time performance. To better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.",

    "abstract": "An important part of electronic dance music (EDM) is the so-called beat. It is defined by the drum track of the piece and is a style defining element. While producing EDM, creating the drum track tends to be delicate, yet labor intensive work. In this work we present a touch-interface-based prototype with the goal to simplify this task. The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances. Starting with a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated. The interface provides simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns. Variations are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library. To evaluate the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in EDM production was conducted. It was found that participants responded positively to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns. Furthermore, the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations and live performances.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging is a powerful tool to explore how and why humans engage in music. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed us to identify brain networks and regions implicated in a range of cognitive tasks including music perception and performance. However, MRI-scanners are noisy and cramped, presenting a challenging environment for playing an instrument. Here, we present an MRI-compatible polyphonic keyboard with a materials cost of 850 USD, designed and tested for safe use in 3T (three Tesla) MRI-scanners. We describe design considerations, and prior work in the field. In addition, we provide recommendations for future designs and comment on the possibility of using the keyboard in magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems. Preliminary results indicate a comfortable playing experience with no disturbance of the imaging process.",

    "abstract": "Music listening has changed greatly with the emergence of music streaming services, such as Spotify or YouTube. In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service. The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the 60’s physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming videos from the platform as musical materials in computer music and introduce a live coding environment that we developed for real-time improvisation.",

We examine sculpture as an integral part of music composition and performance, expanding the definition of musical instrument to include the gestalt of loudspeakers, architectural spaces, and material form. After examining some related works, we frame HIVE as an interactive sculpture for musical expression. We then describe our design and production process, which hinges on the relationship between sound, space, and sculptural form. Finally, we discuss the installation and its implications.",

    "abstract": "The JoyStyx Quartet is a series of four embedded acoustic instruments. Each of these instruments is a five-voice granular synthesizer which processes a different sound source to give each a unique timbre and range. The performer interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay under the performer’s fingertips. The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2. The nature of the JoyStyx construction causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry, leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more “analog” or “natural” sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert, the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.",

    "abstract": "The growth of the live coding community has been coupled with a rich development of experimentation in new domain-specific languages, sometimes idiosyncratic to the interests of their performers. Nevertheless, programming language design may seem foreboding to many, steeped in computer science that is distant from the expertise of music performance. To broaden access to designing unique languages-as-instruments we developed an online programming environment that offers liveness in the process of language design as well as performance. The editor utilizes the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism for language design, and a virtual machine featuring collaborative multitasking for execution, in order to support a diversity of language concepts and affordances. The editor is coupled with online tutorial documentation aimed at the computer music community, with live examples embedded. This paper documents the design and use of the editor and its underlying virtual machine.",

    "abstract": "Brain computer interfaces are being widely adopted for music creation and interpretation, and they are becoming a truly new category of musical instruments. Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to refer to this category. There are no \"plug-n-play\" solutions for a BCMI, these kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial expressions, from the user’s brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the device’s adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also question its reliability and robustness.",

Fluidly moving and mixing numerous sound objects over unique speaker configurations requires specifically designed software interfaces and systems. Currently available software solutions either impose configuration limitations, require extreme degrees of expertise, or extensive configuration time to use. A new system design, focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and live interactive spatialization is described. Automation of array calibration and tuning is included to facilitate rapid deployment and configuration. Comparisons with other solutions show favorability in terms of complexity, depth of control, and required features.",

The system is comprised of an optical sensor mounted in the piano pedal bearing block and an embedded platform for recording audio and sensor data. This enables recording the pedalling gesture of real players and the piano sound under normal playing conditions. Using the gesture data collected from the system, the task of classifying these data by pedalling technique was undertaken using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results can be visualised in an audio based score following application to show pedalling together with the player’s position in the score.",

    "abstract": "While most musical robots that are capable of playing the drum kit utilise a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-hat, with the additional degree of motion provided by its pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians to use. This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously calibrate the hi-hat’s action both before and during a musical performance. This is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms. This new approach allows musicians to create expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment.",

    "abstract": "This research investigates how applying interaction constraints to digital music instruments (DMIs) affects the way that experienced music performers collaborate and find creative ways to make live improvised music on stage. The constraints are applied in two forms: i) Physically implemented on the instruments themselves, and ii) hidden rules that are defined on a network between the instruments and triggered depending on the musical actions of the performers. Six experienced musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance. Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music may not fit with performers’ true intentions. It was also found that when external musical material is introduced to guide the performers into a collective convergence, it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out of context.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents FabricKeyboard: a novel deformable keyboard interface based on a multi-modal fabric sensate surface. Multi-layer fabric sensors that detect touch, proximity, electric field, pressure, and stretch are machine-sewn in a keyboard pattern on a stretchable substrate. The result is a fabric-based musical controller that combines both the discrete controls of a keyboard and various continuous controls from the embedded fabric sensors. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with physical and non-contact gestures: physical by pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting the keys or the fabric and non-contact by hovering and waving towards/against the keyboard and an electromagnetic source. We have also developed additional fabric-based modular interfaces such as a ribbon-controller and trackpad, allowing performers to add more expressive and continuous controls. This paper will discuss implementation strategies for our system-on-textile, fabric-based sensor developments, as well as sensor-computer interfacing and musical mapping examples of this multi-modal and expressive fabric keyboard.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores a new interaction possibility for increasing performer freedom via a foot-mounted wearable, and an instrument-mounted device that maintain stomp-box styles of interactivity, but without the restrictions normally associated with the original design of guitar effect pedals. The classic foot activated effect pedals that are used to alter the sound of the instrument are stationary, forcing the performer to return to the same location in order to interact with the pedals. This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the effect pedals anywhere on the stage. By designing a foot&instrument-mounted effect controller, we kept the strongest part of the classical pedal design, while allowing the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance has been recorded and compared, and their opinion has been investigated through questionnaire and interview. The results of the experiment showed that, in theory, foot&instrument-mounted effect controller can replace standard effect pedals and at the same time provide more mobility on a stage.",

    "abstract": "The need for thorough evaluations is an emerging area of interest and importance in music interaction research. As a large degree of DMI evaluation is concerned with exploring the subjective experience: ergonomics, action-sound mappings and control intimacy; User Experience (UX) methods are increasingly being utilised to analyse an individual’s experience of new musical instruments, from which we can extract meaningful, robust findings and subsequently generalised and useful recommendations. However, many music interaction evaluations remain informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014 – 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to highlight methods from UX’s widening field of research that have not yet been explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.",

    "abstract": "The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument designed to reinterpret and reflect upon the sounds of the instruments it is performed in collaboration with. At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques and settings. These are explored through case studies in a five year history of Fragment String-based compositions and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations of these interactions and their sonic output.",

    "abstract": "Many digital musical instrument design frameworks have been proposed that are well suited for analysis and comparison. However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle but important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers “go beyond the obvious”, and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of “sound and feeling” are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.",

    "abstract": "Exploration is an intrinsic element of designing and engaging with acoustic as well as digital musical instruments. This paper reports on the ongoing development of a virtual-acoustic instrument based on a physical model of a string coupled nonlinearly to a plate. The performer drives the model by tactile interaction with a string-board controller fitted with piezo-electric sensors. The string-plate model is formulated in a way that prioritises its parametric explorability. Where the roles of creating performance gestures and designing instruments are traditionally separated, such a design provides a continuum across these domains. The string-plate model, its real-time implementation, and the control interface are described, and the system is preliminarily evaluated through informal observations of how musicians engage with the system.",

Our Spatial Audio Toolkit for Immersive Environments (SATIE), allows us to render these dense audio scenes to large multi-channel (e.g. 32 or more) loudspeaker systems, in realtime and controlled from external software such as 3D scenegraph software. As we describe here, SATIE is designed for improved scalability: minimum dependency between nodes in the audio DSP graph for parallel audio computation, controlling sound objects by groups and load balancing computation of geometry that allow to reduce the number of messages for controlling simultaneously a high number of sound sources. The paper presents SATIE along with example use case scenarios. Our initial work demonstrates SATIE’s flexibility, and has provided us with novel sonic sensations such as “audio depth of field” and real-time sound swarming.",

We present a first prototype of a user adaptable tool that aims at merging these design and performance steps into one fully interactive experience. It is based on an online learning implementation of a Gaussian Mixture Model supporting real-time adaptation to user movement and generation of sound parameters. To allow both fine-tune modification tasks and open-ended improvisational practices, we designed two interaction modes that either let users shape, or guide interactive motion-sound mappings. Considering an improvisational use case, we propose two example musical applications to illustrate how our tool might support various forms of corporeal engagement with sound, and inspire further perspectives for machine learning-mediated embodied musical expression.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a loudness-based compressor for live audio streams. The need for this device arose while developing the public sound art project The Overheard, which involves mixing together several live audio streams through a web based mixing interface. In order to preserve a natural sounding dynamic image from the varying sound sources that can be played back under varying conditions, an adaptation of the EBU R128 loudness measurement recommendation, originally developed for levelling non-real-time broadcast material, has been applied. The paper describes the Pure Data implementation and the necessary compromises enforced by the live streaming condition. Lastly observations regarding design challenges, related application areas and future goals are presented.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a discussion of the development of hardware systems in collaboration with professional artists, a context which presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers interested in the uses of technology in artistic practice. The establishment of design specifications within these contexts can be challenging, especially as they are likely to change during the development process. In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability. Examples drawn from our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for artistic creation and reusability. We argue that the consideration of these design aspects at appropriate times within the development process may facilitate the ability of hardware systems to support continued use in professional applications.",

The first part presents results from a small series of experiments aimed at finding the baseline micromotion and muscle activation data of people being at rest or performing short/small actions. The second part presents the prototype instrument MicroMyo, built around the concept of making sound with little motion. The instrument plays with the convention that inputting more energy into an instrument results in more sound. MicroMyo, on the other hand, is built so that the less you move, the more it sounds. Our user study shows that while such an \"inverse instrument\" may seem puzzling at first, it also opens a space for interesting musical interactions.",

Stride enables designers to fine tune the sound and the interactivity of the instruments they wish to create. Stride code provides a high-level description of processes in a platform agnostic manner. The syntax used to define these processes can also be used to define low-level signal processing algorithms. Unlike other domain-specific languages for sound synthesis and audio processing, Stride can generate optimized code that can run on any supported hardware platform. The generated code can be compiled to run on a full featured operating system or bare metal on embedded devices. Stride goes further and enables a designer to consolidate various supported hardware and software platforms, define the communication between them, and target them as a single heterogeneous system.",

GeKiPe is developed as part of a creation project, exploring the control of virtual instruments through the analysis of gestures specific to instrumentalists, and to percussionists in particular. GeKiPe was used for the creation of a collaborative stage performance (Sculpt), in which the musician and their movements are captured by different methods (infrared Kinect cameras and gesture-sensors on controller gloves). The use of GeKiPe as an alternate sound and image controller allowed us to combine body movement, musical gestures and audiovisual expressions to create challenging collaborative performances.",

    "abstract": "New digital musical instruments are difficult for organologists to deal with, due to their heterogeneous origins, interdisciplinary science, and fluid, open-ended nature. NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology, engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies. Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing an alternative approach: musical organics . Musical organics is a philosophical attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the Reactable. This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical culture.",

    "abstract": "We propose an approach to insert physical objects in audio digital signal processing chains, filtering the sound with the acoustic impulse response of any solid measured in real-time. We model physical objects as a linear time-invariant system, which is used as an audio filter. By interacting with the object or with the measuring hardware we can dynamically modify the characteristics of the filter. The impulse response is obtained correlating a noise signal injected in the object through an acoustic actuator with the signal received from an acoustic sensor placed on the object. We also present an efficient multichannel implementation of the system, which enables further creative applications beyond audio filtering, including tangible signal patching and sound spatialization.",

    "abstract": "This paper is about a novel robotic guitar that establishes shared control between human performers and mechanical actuators. Unlike other mechatronic guitar instruments that perform pre-programmed music automatically, this guitar allows the human and actuators to produce sounds jointly; there exists a distributed control between the human and robotic components. The interaction allows human performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with a rhythmic pattern. Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports real-time interactive improvising.",

The demonstration will explore the multi-faceted possibilities that are offered by the mutantrumpet in several brief, wide ranging musical examples composed and improvised by Neill. Interactive video performance techniques and collaborations will be integrated into the excerpts. The aesthetics of live intermedia performance will be discussed along with a technical overview of the interface and associated software applications Junxion and RoSa from STEIM, Amsterdam.

    "abstract": "MicroJam is a mobile app for sharing tiny touch-screen performances. Mobile applications that streamline creativity and social interaction have enabled a very broad audience to develop their own creative practices. While these apps have been very successful in visual arts (particularly photography), the idea of social music-making has not had such a broad impact. MicroJam includes several novel performance concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen performances are limited to five seconds, instrument settings are posed as sonic “filters”, and past performances are arranged as a timeline with replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu ensemble music making.",

Arcontinuo aims to change the way electronic music is performed, as it is capable of incorporating natural and ergonomic human gestures, allowing the musician to engage with the instrument and as a result, enhance the connection with the audience. Arcontinuo challenges the notion of what a musical gesture is and goes against traditional ways of performing music, by proposing a concept that we call smart playing mapping, as a way of achieving a better and more meaningful performance.",

The work demonstrates an attempt to apply theories and techniques from visual collage art to the concept of musical performance ecologies. The body of the instrument emerged from material-led making, and the disparate elements of a particular musical performance ecology (acoustic instrument, audio effects, samples, synthesis and controls) are juxtaposed and unified into one coherent whole. As such, Kalimbo demonstrates how visual arts, in particular collage, can inform the design and creation of new musical instruments, interfaces and streamlined performance ecologies.",

The system generates the improvised melodies based on (1) an outline sketched by the user using a mouse or a touch screen, (2) a genetic algorithm based on a dataset of existing music pieces as well as musical knowledge, and (3) an expressive performance model for timing and dynamic transformations. The aim of the system is to allow people with no prior musical knowledge to be able to enjoy playing music by improvising melodies in real time.",

    "abstract": "We present an attachment for the bass guitar which allows MIDI-controlled actuated fretting. This adapted instrument is presented as a potential method of augmenting the bass guitar for those with upper-limb disabilities. We conducted an online survey of 48 bassists in order to highlight the most important aspects of bass playing. We found that timbral and dynamic features related to the plucking hand were most important to the survey respondents. We designed an actuated fretting mechanism to replace the role of the fretting hand in order to preserve plucking hand techniques. We then conducted a performance study in which experienced bassists prepared and performed an accompaniment to a backing track with the adapted bass. The performances highlighted ways in which adapting a fretted string instrument in this way impacts plucking hand technique.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio processing are utilized. Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument’s sound is modified by the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.",

    "abstract": "Musebots are autonomous musical agents that interact with other musebots to produce music. Inaugurated in 2015, musebots are now an established practice in the field of musical metacreation, which aims to automate aspects of creative practice. Originally musebot development focused on software-only ensembles of musical agents, coded by a community of developers. More recent experiments have explored humans interfacing with musebot ensembles in various ways: including through electronic interfaces in which parametric control of high-level musebot parameters are used; message-based interfaces which allow human users to communicate with musebots in their own language; and interfaces through which musebots have jammed with human musicians. Here we report on the recent developments of human interaction with musebot ensembles and reflect on some of the implications of these developments for the design of metacreative music systems.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how audio augmented reality can engender new collective modes of musical expression in the context of a sound art installation, ’Listening Mirrors’, exploring the creation of interactive sound environments for musicians and non-musicians alike. ’Listening Mirrors’ is designed to incorporate physical objects and computational systems for altering the acoustic environment, to enhance collective listening and challenge traditional musician-instrument performance. At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected interview evidence about the participants’ experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach. The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment. The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds so that there is space for interplay between the two.",

We re-implemented the Whirlwind by using real-world physical objects to comprise a sound installation. The sound propagation between a speaker and microphone was used as the delay, and a paper cylinder was employed as the resonator.

    "abstract": "Many common and popular sound spatialisation techniques and methods rely on listeners being positioned in a \"sweet-spot” for an optimal listening position in a circle of speakers. This paper discusses a stochastic spatialisation method and its first iteration as implemented for the exhibition Hot Pocket at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Oslo in 2017. This method is implemented in Max and offers a matrix-based amplitude panning methodology which can provide a flexible means for the spatialialisation of sounds.",

    "abstract": "AM MODE is a custom-designed software interface for electronic augmentation of the acoustic drum set. The software is used in the development a series of recordings, similarly titled as AM MODE. Programmed in Max/MSP, the software uses live audio input from individual instruments within the drum set as control parameters for modulation synthesis. By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers, audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications. The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming a sonic hybrid.",

This is achieved when the body, through the skin, relays signals from control & audio sources to the inputs of the instrument. These signals can be harnessed from the environment, from within the Kinesynths internal synthesizer, or from external instrument, making the Kinesynth a mediator between the body and the environment.",

    "abstract": "CABOTO is an interactive system for live performance and composition. A graphic score sketched on paper is read by a computer vision system. The graphic elements are scanned following a symbolic-raw hybrid approach, that is, they are recognised and classified according to their shapes but also scanned as waveforms and optical signals. All this information is mapped into the synthesis engine, which implements different kind of synthesis techniques for different shapes. In CABOTO the score is viewed as a cartographic map explored by some navigators. These navigators traverse the score in a semi-autonomous way, scanning the graphic elements found along their paths. The system tries to challenge the boundaries between the concepts of composition, score, performance, instrument, since the musical result will depend both on the composed score and the way the navigators will traverse it during the live performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the concept, design, and realization of two iterations of a new controller called the XT Synth. The development of the instrument came from the desire to maintain the expressivity and familiarity of string instruments, while adding the flexibility and power usually found in keyboard controllers. There are different examples of instruments that bring the physicality and expressiveness of acoustic instruments into electronic music, from Do it yourself (DIY) products to commercially available ones. This paper discusses the process and the challenges faced when creating a DIY musical instrument and then subsequently transforming the instrument into a product suitable for commercialization.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study examining the effects of disfluent design on audience perception of digital musical instrument (DMI) performance. Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.",

    "abstract": "The voice of the theremin is more than just a simple sine wave. Its unique sound is made through two radio frequency oscillators that, when operating at almost identical frequencies, gravitate towards each other. Ultimately, this pull alters the sine wave, creating the signature sound of the theremin. The Theremin Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremins ability, enabling it to produce five distinct new textures beyond the original. It also features a looping system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Siren, a hybrid system for algorithmic composition and live-coding performances. Its hierarchical structure allows small modifications to propagate and aggregate on lower levels for dramatic changes in the musical output. It uses functional programming language TidalCycles as the core pattern creation environment due to its inherent ability to create complex pattern relations with minimal syntax. Borrowing the best from TidalCycles, Siren augments the pattern creation process by introducing various interface level features: a multi-channel sequencer, local and global parameters, mathematical expressions, and pattern history. It presents new opportunities for recording, refining, and reusing the playback information with the pattern roll component. Subsequently, the paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of Siren in the context of user interface design principles, which originates from the cognitive dimensions framework for musical notation design.",

MOM combines a real-time signal processing engine implemented with Pure Data on an embedded Linux platform, with gestural interaction implemented via a variety of analog and digital sensors. Power, sound-input and sound-diffusion subsystems make the instrument autonomous and mobile. This instrument was designed in coordination with the development of an evening-length dance/music performance in which the performing musician is engaged in choreographed movements with the mobile instruments. The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers. The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators.",

    "abstract": "The Harmonic Wand is a transducer-based instrument that combines physical excitation, synthesis, and gestural control. Our objective was to design a device that affords exploratory modes of interaction with the performers surroundings, as well as precise control over microtonal pitch content and other concomitant parameters. The instrument is comprised of a hand-held wand, containing two piezo-electric transducers affixed to a pair of metal probes. The performer uses the wand to physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals. Input materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis, in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances. We achieved gestural control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch. As a unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partchs monophonic fabric of Just Intonationspecifically his conception of odentities, udentities, and a variable numerary nexus. This system classifies pitch content based upon intervallic structures found in both the overtone and undertone series. Our paper details the procedural challenges in designing the Harmonic Wand.",

    "abstract": "Sansa is an extended sansula, a hyper-instrument that is similar in design and functionality to a kalimba or thumb piano. At the heart of this interface is a series of sensors that are used to augment the tone and expand the performance capabilities of the instrument. The sensor data is further exploited using the machine learning program Wekinator, which gives users the ability to interact and perform with the instrument using several different modes of operation. In this way, Sansa is capable of both solo acoustic performances as well as complex productions that require interactions between multiple technological mediums. Sansa expands the current community of hyper-instruments by demonstrating the ways that hardware and software can extend an acoustic instrument’s functionality and playability in a live performance or studio setting.",

    "abstract": "Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments. These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation, timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical expression stems from the transitive perspective that musical expression is an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical expression focus on an intransitive perspective, where musical meaning is generated as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative capabilities unique to robotic instruments.",

    "abstract": "Musical participation has brought individuals together in on-going communities throughout human history, aiding in the kinds of social integration essential for wellbeing. The design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), however, has generally been driven by idiosyncratic artistic concerns, Western art music and dance traditions of expert performance, and short-lived interactive art installations engaging a broader public of musical novices. These DMIs rarely engage with the problems of on-going use in musical communities with existing performance idioms, repertoire, and social codes with participants representing the full learning curve of musical skill, such as social dance. Our project, Interactive Tango Milonga, an interactive Argentine tango dance system for social dance addresses these challenges in order to innovate connection, the feeling of intense relation between dance partners, music, and the larger tango community.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experiment to investigate how new types of vocal practices can affect psychophysiological activity. We know that health can influence the voice, but can a certain use of the voice influence health through modification of mental and physical state? This study took place in the setting of the Vocal Vibrations installation. For the experiment, participants engage in a multi sensory vocal exercise with a limited set of guidance to obtain a wide spectrum of vocal performances across participants. We compare characteristics of those vocal practices to the participants heart rate, breathing rate, electrodermal activity and mental states. We obtained significant results suggesting that we can correlate psychophysiological states with characteristics of the vocal practice if we also take into account biographical information, and in particular mea- surement of how much people like their own voice.",

    "abstract": "In order to facilitate access to playing music spontaneously, the prototype of an instrument which allows a more natural learning approach was developed as part of the research project Drum-Dance-Music-Machine. The result was a modular system consisting of several VST plug-ins, which on the one hand provides a drum interface to create sounds and tones and on the other hand generates or manipulates music through dance movement, in order to simplify the understanding of more abstract characteristics of music. This paper describes the development of a new software concept for the prototype, which since then has been further developed and evaluated several times. This will improve the maintainability and extensibility of the system and eliminate design weaknesses. To do so, the existing system first will be analyzed and requirements for a new framework, which is based on the concepts of event driven architecture and dependency injection, will be defined. The components are then transferred to the new system and their performance is assessed. The approach chosen in this case study and the lessons learned are intended to provide a viable solution for solving similar problems in the development of modular VST-based NIMEs.",

It embodies an audio-driven, sound-first approach that integrates audio programming and graphics programming in the same workflow, taking advantage of strongly-timed audio programming features of the ChucK programming language and the state-of-the-art real-time graphics engine found in Unity. We describe both the system and its intended workflow for the creation of expressive audiovisual works. Chunity was evaluated as the primary software platform in a computer music and design course, where students created a diverse assortment of interactive audiovisual software. We present results from the evaluation and discuss Chunity’s usability, utility, and aesthetics as a way of working. Through these, we argue for Chunity as a unique and useful way to program sound, graphics, and interaction in tandem, giving users the flexibility to use a game engine to do much more than \"just\" make games.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we expand on prior research into the use of Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) as evolvable generators of musical structures such as audio waveforms. This type of neural network has a compact structure and is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties, we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work, we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery of the CTRNN creative search space.",

    "abstract": "Research into machine listening has intensified in recent years creating a variety of techniques for recognising musical features suitable, for example, in musicological analysis or commercial application in song recognition. Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of hijacking formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a system for easily augmenting polyphonic pitched instruments. The entire system is designed to run on a low-cost embedded computer, suitable for live performance and easy to customise for different use cases. The core of the system implements real-time spectrum factorisation, decomposing polyphonic audio input signals into music note activations. New instruments can be easily added to the system with the help of custom spectral template dictionaries. Instrument augmentation is achieved by replacing or mixing the instrument’s original sounds with a large variety of synthetic or sampled sounds, which follow the polyphonic pitch activations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces various ways that idiomatic gestures emerge in performance practice with new musical instruments. It demonstrates that idiomatic gestures can play an important role in the development of personalized performance practices that can be the basis for the development of style and expression. Three detailed examples – biocontrollers, accordion-inspired instruments, and a networked intelligent controller – illustrate how a complex suite of factors throughout the design, composition and performance processes can influence the development of idiomatic gestures. We argue that the explicit consideration of idiomatic gestures throughout the life cycle of new instruments can facilitate the emergence of style and give rise to performances that can develop rich layers of meaning.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning has recently made a large impact in the artistic community. In many of these applications however, the model is often used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output defined in the synth engine. The system relies on learning these movements from a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output, our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the Lightpad instrument.",

    "abstract": "Myo Mapper is a free and open source cross-platform application to map data from the gestural device Myo armband into Open Sound Control (OSC) messages. It represents a ‘quick and easy’ solution for exploring the Myo’s potential for realising new interfaces for musical expression. Together with details of the software, this paper reports some applications in which Myo Mapper has been successfully used and a qualitative evaluation. We then proposed guidelines for using Myo data in interactive artworks based on insight gained from the works described and the evaluation. Findings show that Myo Mapper empowers artists and non-skilled developers to easily take advantage of Myo data high-level features for realising interactive artistic works. It also facilitates the recognition of poses and gestures beyond those included with the product by using third-party interactive machine learning software.",

    "abstract": "We present modosc, a set of Max abstractions designed for computing motion descriptors from raw motion capture data in real time. The library contains methods for extracting descriptors useful for expressive movement analysis and sonic interaction design. modosc is designed to address the data handling and synchronization issues that often arise when working with complex marker sets. This is achieved by adopting a multiparadigm approach facilitated by odot and Open Sound Control to overcome some of the limitations of conventional Max programming, and structure incoming and outgoing data streams in a meaningful and easily accessible manner. After describing the contents of the library and how data streams are structured and processed, we report on a sonic interaction design use case involving motion feature extraction and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices have been a promising platform for musical performance thanks to the various sensors readily available on board. In particular, mobile cameras can provide rich input as they can capture a wide variety of user gestures or environment dynamics. However, this raw camera input only provides continuous parameters and requires expensive computation. In this paper, we propose to combine motion/gesture input with the touch input, in order to filter movement information both temporally and spatially, thus increasing expressiveness while reducing computation time. We present a design space which demonstrates the diversity of interactions that our technique enables. We also report the results of a user study in which we observe how musicians appropriate the interaction space with an example instrument.",

    "abstract": "Many digital interfaces for audio effects still resemble racks and cases of their hardware counterparts. For instance, DSP-algorithms are often adjusted via direct value input, sliders, or knobs. While recent research has started to experiment with the capabilities offered by modern interfaces, there are no examples for productive applications such as audio-morphing. Audio-morphing as a special field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization. Using multi-touch gestures to manipulate audio-morphing in a visual way, sound design and music production becomes more unrestricted and creative.",

    "abstract": "Traditional instrument learning procedure is time-consuming; it begins with learning music notations and necessitates layers of sophistication and abstraction. Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However, the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments. Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not tone deaf. Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30",

    "abstract": "The term ‘NIME’ - New Interfaces for Musical Expression - has come to signify both technical and cultural characteristics. Not all new musical instruments are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition of being new. So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers’ practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers’ practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.",

The New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference is not an exception, with a number of open questions remaining around the issue. In the present paper, we study the presence and evolution over time of women authors in NIME since the beginning of the conference in 2001 until 2017. We discuss the results of such a gender imbalance and potential solutions by summarizing the actions taken by a number of worldwide initiatives that have put an effort into making women’s work visible in our field, with a particular emphasis on Women in Music Tech (WiMT), a student-led organization that aims to encourage more women to join music technology, as a case study. We conclude with a hope for an improvement in the representation of women in NIME by presenting WiNIME, a public online database that details who are the women authors in NIME.",

This is a difficult task to achieve: many new instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performers movement translates into the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians. In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness. This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result only seems to be true for expert players.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the prevailing longevity problem of digital musical instruments (DMIs) in NIME research and design by proposing a holistic system design approach. Despite recent efforts to examine the main contributing factors of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to remedy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts establishing themselves, their design processes and technologies. However, few existing studies have attempted to proactively build a community around technological platforms for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and activities necessary for a budding community. We observe that such attempts while important in their undertaking, are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic factors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must not only take into account a target community but it may also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sustains artistic practice.",

The T-Sticks were originally conceived in 2006 and 20 copies have been built over the last 12 years. While they all preserve the original design concept, their evolution resulted in variations in choice of microcontrollers, and sensors. We worked with eight copies of the second and fourth generation T-Sticks to overcome issues related to the aging of components, changes in external software, lack of documentation, and in general, the problem of technical maintenance.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of the ubiquitous MIDI keyboard to control a DJ performance system. The prototype system uses a two octave keyboard with each octave controlling one audio track. Each audio track has four two-bar loops which play in synchronisation switchable by its respective octaves first four black keys. The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface. All subjects agreed that all tools had creative performance potential that could be developed by further practice.",

It is designed to facilitate the creation of simple mechatronics systems for physical sound production in K-12 and production scenarios. The new set of objects builds on the existing support for the Raspberry Pi platform to also include the use of electric actuators via the microcomputers GPIO system. Moreover, we discuss implications of the newly introduced kit in the creative and K-12 education scenarios by sharing observations from a series of pilot workshops, with particular focus on using mechatronic NIMEs as a catalyst for the development of programing skills.",

    "abstract": "We describe the development of Neurythmic: an interactive system for the creation and performance of fluid, expressive musical rhythms using Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). CPGs are neural networks which generate adaptive rhythmic signals. They simulate structures in animals which underly behaviours such as heartbeat, gut peristalsis and complex motor control. Neurythmic is the first such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties of the CPG networks used (Matsuoka’s Neural Oscillator), and describe methods for their control. Evaluation with expert and professional musicians shows that Neurythmic is a versatile tool, adapting well to a range of quite different musical approaches.",

    "abstract": "Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface, finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between compositions that used either interface.",

    "abstract": "Playsound.space is a web-based tool to search for and play Creative Commons licensed-sounds which can be applied to free improvisation, experimental music production and soundscape composition. It provides a fast access to about 400k non-musical and musical sounds provided by Freesound, and allows users to play/loop single or multiple sounds retrieved through text based search. Sound discovery is facilitated by use of semantic searches and sound visual representations (spectrograms). Guided by the motivation to create an intuitive tool to support music practice that could suit both novice and trained musicians, we developed and improved the system in a continuous process, gathering frequent feedback from a range of users with various skills. We assessed the prototype with 18 non musician and musician participants during free music improvisation sessions. Results indicate that the system was found easy to use and supports creative collaboration and expressiveness irrespective of musical ability. We identified further design challenges linked to creative identification, control and content quality.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a new interface for the production and distribution of high resolution analog control signals, particularly aimed toward the control of analog modular synthesisers. Control Voltage/Gate interfaces generate Control Voltage (CV) and Gate Voltage (Gate) as a means of controlling note pitch and length respectively, and have been with us since 1986 \\[2\\]. The authors provide a unique custom CV/Gate interface and dedicated communication protocol which leverages standard USB Serial functionality and enables connectivity over a plethora of computing devices, including embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi and ARM based devices including widely available Android TV Boxes. We provide a general overview of the unique hardware and communication protocol developments followed by usage case examples toward tuning and embedded platforms, leveraging softwares ranging from Pure Data (Pd), Max, and Max for Live (M4L).",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a machine learning approach in the context of non-idiomatic human-machine improvisation. In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor two motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters. Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system. When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.",

    "abstract": "InterFACE is an interactive system for musical creation, mediated primarily through the users facial expressions and movements. It aims to take advantage of the expressive capabilities of the human face to create music in a way that is both expressive and whimsical. This paper introduces the designs of three virtual instruments in the InterFACE system: namely, FACEdrum (a drum machine), GrannyFACE (a granular synthesis sampler), and FACEorgan (a laptop mouth organ using both face tracking and audio analysis). We present the design behind these instruments and consider what it means to be able to create music with ones face. Finally, we discuss the usability and aesthetic criteria for evaluating such a system, taking into account our initial design goals as well as the resulting experience for the performer and audience.",

    "abstract": "Hands are important anatomical structures for musical performance, and recent developments in input device technology have allowed rather detailed capture of hand gestures using consumer-level products. While in some musical contexts, detailed hand and finger movements are required, in others it is sufficient to communicate discrete hand postures to indicate selection or other state changes. This research compared three approaches to capturing hand gestures where the shape of the hand, i.e. the relative positions and angles of finger joints, are an important part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages for music applications. This study compared three approaches, using optical, inertial and muscular information, with three sets of 5 hand postures (i.e. static gestures) and gesture recognition algorithms applied to the device data, aiming to determine which methods are most effective.",

    "abstract": "JythonMusic is a software environment for developing interactive musical experiences and systems. It is based on jMusic, a software environment for computer-assisted composition, which was extended within the last decade into a more comprehensive framework providing composers and software developers with libraries for music making, image manipulation, building graphical user interfaces, and interacting with external devices via MIDI and OSC, among others. This environment is free and open source. It is based on Python, therefore it provides more economical syntax relative to Java- and C/C++-like languages. JythonMusic rests on top of Java, so it provides access to the complete Java API and external Java-based libraries as needed. Also, it works seamlessly with other software, such as PureData, Max/MSP, and Processing. The paper provides an overview of important JythonMusic libraries related to constructing interactive musical experiences. It demonstrates their scope and utility by summarizing several projects developed using JythonMusic, including interactive sound art installations, new interfaces for sound manipulation and spatialization, as well as various explorations on mapping among motion, gesture and music.",

Using industrial-grade weight-detection sensors and widely-adopted communication protocols, the Triplexer offers a flexible platform that can be integrated into various performance setups and situations. In this paper, we detail the design of the Triplexer by describing its hardware, embedded signal processing, and mapping software implementations.

    "abstract": "This paper reports upon the process of innovation of a new instrument. The author has developed the halldorophone a new electroacoustic string instrument which makes use of positive feedback as a key element in generating its sound. An important objective of the project has been to encourage its use by practicing musicians. After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: why do musicians want to use this instrument? and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument. This paper describes the halldorophone and presents the rationale for its major design features and ergonomic choices, as they relate to the overarching objective of nurturing a culture of use and connects it to wider trends.",

    "abstract": "Laptop orchestras create music, although digitally produced, in a collaborative live performance not unlike a traditional orchestra. The recent increase in interest and investment in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel methods for musicians to create and interact with music. To this end, a number of nontraditional instruments have been constructed that enable musicians to control sound production beyond pitch and volume, integrating filtering, musical effects, etc. Wii Remotes (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use in maker communities, including laptop orchestras, for their robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music creation. In this paper, the authors present a new controller design, based on the WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-centric music performance. Based on the pilot-study data, the new controller offers unrestricted two-hand gesture production, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.",

    "abstract": "In digital musical instrument design, different tools and methods offer a variety of approaches for constraining the exploration of musical gestures and sounds. Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to further investigate and extend this approach.",

    "abstract": "Incremental robotic sheet forming is used to fabricate a novel cymbal shape based on models of geometric chaos for stadium shaped boundaries. This provides a proof-of-concept that this robotic fabrication technique might be a candidate method for creating novel metallic ideophones that are based on sheet deformations. Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication. In this paper we discuss this technique as well as aspects of the geometry of stadium cymbals and their impact on the resulting instrument.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports the development of a haptic-listening system which presents the listener with a representation of the vibrotactile feedback perceived by a classical guitarist during performance through the use of haptic feedback technology. The paper describes the design of the haptic-listening system which is in two prototypes: the DIY Haptic Guitar and a more robust haptic-listening Trial prototype using a Reckhorn BS-200 shaker. Through two experiments, the perceptual significance and overall musical contribution of the addition of haptic feedback in a listening context was evaluated. Subjects preferred listening to the classical guitar presentation with the addition of haptic feedback and the addition of haptic feedback contributed to listeners engagement with a performance. The results of the experiments and their implications are discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The design of traditional musical instruments is a process of incremental refinement over many centuries of innovation. Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed varying degrees of ‘guitar-likeness’, based either on the form and aesthetics of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures.",

    "abstract": "Common emotional effects following a stroke include depression, apathy and lack of motivation. We conducted a longitudinal case study to investigate if enabling a post-stroke former guitarist re-learn to play guitar would help increase motivation for self rehabilitation and quality of life after suffering a stroke. The intervention lasted three weeks during which the participant had a fully functional electrical guitar fitted with a strumming device controlled by a foot pedal at his free disposal. The device replaced right strumming of the strings, and the study showed that the participant, who was highly motivated, played 20 sessions despite system latency and reduced musical expression. He incorporated his own literature and equipment into his playing routine and improved greatly as the study progressed. He was able to play alone and keep a steady rhythm in time with backing tracks that went as fast as 120bpm. During the study he was able to lower his error rate to 33",

    "abstract": "In this paper we report preliminary observations from an ongoing study into how musicians explore and adapt to the parameter space of a virtual-acoustic string bridge plate instrument. These observations inform (and are informed by) a wider approach to understanding the development of skill and style in interactions between musicians and musical instruments. We discuss a performance-driven ecosystemic approach to studying musical relationships, drawing on arguments from the literature which emphasise the need to go beyond simplistic notions of control and usability when assessing exploratory and performatory musical interactions. Lastly, we focus on processes of perceptual learning and co-tuning between musician and instrument, and how these activities may contribute to the emergence of personal style as a hallmark of skilful music-making.",

    "abstract": "The environment of zero gravity affords a unique medium for new modalities of musical performance, both in the design of instruments, and human interactions with said instruments. To explore this medium, we have created and flown Telemetron, the first musical instrument specifically designed for and tested in the zero gravity environment. The resultant instrument (leveraging gyroscopes and wireless telemetry transmission) and recorded performance represent an initial exploration of compositions that are unique to the physics and dynamics of outer space. We describe the motivations for this instrument, and the unique constraints involved in designing for this environment. This initial design suggests possibilities for further experiments in musical instrument design for outer space.",

    "abstract": "This paper covers the technical and aesthetic development of robotcowboy, the author’s ongoing human-computer wearable performance project. Conceived as an idiosyncratic manifesto on the embodiment of computational sound, the original robotcowboy system was built in 2006-2007 using a belt-mounted industrial wearable computer running GNU/Linux and Pure Data, external USB audio/MIDI interfaces, HID gamepads, and guitar. Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this first iteration \"Cabled Madness\" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration \"Onward to Mars\" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit backpack. Now 10 years on, a new \"robotcowboy 2.0\" system powers a third iteration with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author’s open-source iOS application which runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller support, and Open Sound Control communication. The future is bright, do you have room to wiggle?",

    "abstract": "This article describes the design and construction of a collection of digitally-controlled augmented acoustic guitars, and the use of these guitars in the installation <i>{</i>Sverm-Resonans}. The installation was built around the idea of exploring ‘inverse’ sonic microinteraction, that is, controlling sounds by the micromotion observed when attempting to stand still. It consisted of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind, and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional ‘performance’ technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound, and vibration, and that the ‘inverse’ control of the instrument was both challenging and pleasant.",

The hardware answers one problem: how to extend violin playing in a minimal yet powerful way; the software answers another: how to create a rich, evolving response that enhances expression in improvisation. The author approaches this problem from the various roles of violinist, hardware technician, programmer, sound designer, composer, and improviser. Importantly, the alto.glove is designed to be cost-effective and relatively easy to build.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a brief overview of an online survey conducted with the objective of gaining insight into compositional and performance practices of contemporary audiovisual practitioners. The survey gathered information regarding how practitioners relate aural and visual media in their work, and how compositional and performance practices involving multiple modalities might differ from other practices. Discussed here are three themes: compositional approaches, transparency and audience knowledge, and error and risk, which emerged from participants’ responses. We believe these themes contribute to a discussion within the NIME community regarding unique challenges and objectives presented when working with multiple media.",

    "abstract": "The author presents Sound Opinions, a custom software tool that uses sentiment analysis to create sound art installations and music compositions. The software runs inside the NodeRed.js programming environment. It scrapes text from web pages, pre-processes it, performs sentiment analysis via a remote API, and parses the resulting data for use in external digital audio programs. The sentiment analysis itself is handled by IBM’s Watson Tone Analyzer. The author has used this tool to create an interactive multimedia installation, titled Critique. Sources of criticism of a chosen musical work are analyzed and the negative or positive statements about that composition work to warp and change it. This allows the audience to only hear the work through the lens of its critics, and not in the original form that its creator intended.",

    "abstract": "We developed a new musical interface, CubeHarmonic, with the magnetic tracking system, IM3D, created at Tohoku University. IM3D system precisely tracks positions of tiny, wireless, battery-less, and identifiable LC coils in real time. The CubeHarmonic is a musical application of the Rubik’s cube, with notes on each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get different chords and chord sequences. Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik’s cube, and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a recreational tool.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel digital effects controller for electric guitar based upon the whammy bar as a user interface. The goal with the project is to give guitarists a way to interact with dynamic effects control that feels familiar to their instrument and playing style. A 3D-printed prototype has been made. It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.",

    "abstract": "The process of learning to play a string instrument is a notoriously difficult task. A new student to the instrument is faced with mastering multiple, interconnected physical movements in order to become a skillful player. In their development, one measure of a players quality is their tone, which is the result of the combination of the physical characteristics of the instrument and their technique in playing it. This paper describes preliminary research into creating an intuitive, real-time device for evaluating the quality of tone generation on the cello: a “timbre-tuner\" to aid cellists evaluate their tone quality. Data for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at different pitches on the A string was created. Results from informal listening tests support the use of the harmonic centroid as an appropriate measure for tone quality.",

    "abstract": "This demonstration paper describes the concepts behind Tributaries of Our Distant Palpability, an interactive sonified sculpture. It takes form as a swelling sea anemone, while the sounds it produces recall the quagmire of a digital ocean. The sculpture responds to changing light conditions with a dynamic mix of audio tracks, mapping volume to light level. People passing by the sculpture, or directly engaging it by creating light and shadows with their smart phone flashlights, will trigger the audio. At the same time, it automatically adapts to gradual environment light changes, such as the rise and fall of the sun. The piece was inspired by the searching gestures people make, and emotions they have while, idly browsing content on their smart devices. It was created through an interdisciplinary collaboration between a musician, an interaction designer, and a ceramicist.",

    "abstract": "The recent increase in the accessibility and size of personal and crowdsourced digital sound collections brought about a valuable resource for music creation. Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the question of how live coding musicians can perform with musicians who are not using code (such as acoustic instrumentalists or those using graphical and tangible electronic interfaces). This paper investigates performance systems that facilitate improvisation where the musicians can interact not just by listening to each other and changing their own output, but also by manipulating the data stream of the other performer(s). In a course of performance-led research four prototypes were built and analyzed them using concepts from NIME and creative collaboration literature. Based on this analysis it was found that the systems should 1) provide a commonly modifiable visual representation of musical data for both coder and non-coder, and 2) provide some independent means of sound production for each user, giving the non-coder the ability to slow down and make non-realtime decisions for greater performance flexibility.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the role of materiality in Digital Musical Instruments and questions the influence of tacit understandings of sensor technology. Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the sensor layer brings with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response.",

    "abstract": "At first glance, the practice of musical live coding seems distanced from the gestures and sense of embodiment common in musical performance, electronic or otherwise. This workshop seeks to explore the extent to which this assertion is justified, to re-examine notions of gesture and embodiment in the context of musical live coding performance, to consider historical approaches to synthesizing musical programming and gesture, and to look to the future for new ways of doing so. The workshop will consist firstly of a critical discussion of these issues and related literature. This will be followed by applied practical experiments involving ideas generated during these discussions. The workshop will conclude with a recapitulation and examination of these experiments in the context of previous research and proposed future directions.",

    "abstract": "For the purpose of creating new musical instruments, chaotic dynamical systems can be simulated in real time to synthesize complex sounds. This work investigates a series of discrete-time chaotic maps, which have the potential to generate intriguing sounds when they are adjusted to be on the edge of chaos. With these chaotic maps as studied historically, the edge of chaos tends to be razor-thin, which can make it difficult to employ them for making new musical instruments. The authors therefore suggest connecting chaotic maps with digital waveguides, which (1) make it easier to synthesize harmonic tones and (2) make it harder to fall off of the edge of chaos while playing a musical instrument. The authors argue therefore that this technique widens the razor-thin edge of chaos into a musical highway.",

    "abstract": "In computer or electroacoustic music, it is often the case that the compositional act and the parametric control of the underlying synthesis algorithms or hardware are not separable from each other. In these situations, composition and control of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy approach.",

    "abstract": "Playing musical instruments involves producing gradually more challenging body movements and transitions, where the kinematic constraints of the body play a crucial role in structuring the resulting music. We seek to make a bridge between currently accessible motor patterns, and musical possibilities beyond those - afforded through the use of a robotic augmentation. Guitar Machine is a robotic device that presses on guitar strings and assists a musician by fretting alongside her on the same guitar. This paper discusses the design of the system, strategies for using the system to create novel musical patterns, and a user study that looks at the effects of the temporary acquisition of enhanced physical ability. Our results indicate that the proposed human-robot interaction would equip users to explore new musical avenues on the guitar, as well as provide an enhanced understanding of the task at hand on the basis of the robotically acquired ability.",

    "abstract": "Percussive aerophones are configurable, modular, scalable, and can be constructed from commonly found materials. They can produce rich timbres, a wide range of pitches and complex polyphony. Their use by humans, perhaps most famously by the Blue Man Group, inspired us to build an electromechanically-actuated version of the instrument in order to explore expressive possibilities enabled by machines. The Music, Perception, and Robotics Lab at WPI has iteratively designed, built and composed for a robotic percussive aerophone since 2015, which has both taught lessons in actuation and revealed promising musical capabilities of the instrument.",

    "abstract": "This book is a comprehensive introductory presentation of the key research areas in the interdisciplinary fields of sonification and auditory display. Chapters are written by leading experts, providing a wide-range coverage of the central issues, and can be read from start to finish, or dipped into as required (like a smorgasbord menu). Sonification conveys information by using non-speech sounds. To listen to data as sound and noise can be a surprising new experience with diverse applications ranging from novel interfaces for visually impaired people to data analysis problems in many scientific fields. This book gives a solid introduction to the field of auditory display, the techniques for sonification, suitable technologies for developing sonification algorithms, and the most promising application areas. The book is accompanied by the online repository of sound examples.",

In sharp contrast to existing data management approaches, where human input is either ad-hoc or is never used, we describe the design of the first declarative language involving human-computable functions, standard relational operators, as well as algorithmic computation. We consider the challenges involved in optimizing queries posed in this language, in particular, the tradeoffs between uncertainty, cost and performance, as well as combination of human and algorithmic evidence. We believe that the vision laid out in this paper can act as a road-map for a new area of data management research where human computation is routinely used in data analytics.",

Confidence values may be known imprecisely or coarsely, or even be missing altogether. We propose a generalized uncertain database that can manage data with such incomplete knowledge of uncertainty. We develop a semantics for generalized uncertain databases based on Dempster-Shafer theory. We propose a representation scheme for generalized uncertain databases that generalizes the Trio representation. Our approach builds upon Trio’s query processing techniques to extend them to operate on generalized uncertain databases.",

    "abstract": "The query models of the recent generation of very large scale distributed (VLSD) shared-nothing data storage systems, including our own PNUTS and others (e.g. BigTable, Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) are intentionally simple, focusing on simple lookups and scans and trading query expressiveness for massive scale. Indexes and views can expand the query expressiveness of such systems by materializing more complex access paths and query results. In this paper, we examine mechanisms to implement indexes and views in a massive scale distributed database. For web applications, minimizing update latencies is critical, so we advocate deferring the work of maintaining views and indexes as much as possible. We examine the design space, and conclude that two types of view implementations, called remote view tables (RVTs) and local view tables (LVTs), provide a good tradeoff between system throughput and minimizing view staleness. We describe how to construct and maintain such view tables, and how they can be used to implement indexes, group-by-aggregate views, equijoin views and selection views. We also introduce and analyze a consistency model that makes it easier for application developers to cope with the impact of deferred view maintenance. An empirical evaluation quantifies the maintenance costs of our views, and shows that they can significantly improve the cost of evaluating complex queries.",

    "abstract": "Many applications offer a form-based environment for naı̈ve users for accessing databases without being familiar with the database schema or a structured query language. Do-It-Yourself, database-driven web application platforms empower non-programmers to rapidly create applications. Users interactions are translated to structured queries and executed. However, as a user is unlikely to know the underlying semantic connections among the fields presented in a form, it is often useful to provide her with some feedback about the queries built without exposing her to the underlying query language, in order to assist her in forming queries correctly. Explaining queries may be also useful for users who explicitly use a structured query language for verification or debugging purposes. In this paper, we take a graph-based approach to the query translation problem. We represent various forms of structured queries as directed graphs and we annotate the graph edges with template labels using an extensible template mechanism. We present different graph traversal strategies for efficiently exploring these graphs and composing textual query descriptions. Finally, we present experimental results for the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "We address schema design in uncertain databases such as are found in Trio. Since uncertain data is relational in nature, decomposition becomes a key issue in design. Decomposition relies on dependency theory, and primarily on functional dependencies. We study the theory of functional dependencies (FDs) for uncertain relations. We define several kinds of <i>horizonal</i> FDs and <i>vertical</i> FDs, each of which is consistent with conventional FDs when an uncertain relation doesn’t contain any uncertainty. In addition to standard forms of decompositions allowed by ordinary relations, our FDs allow more complex decompositions specific to uncertain data. First we give a sound and complete axiomatization of horizontal and vertical FDs. Next we show how our theory of FDs can be used for lossless decomposition of uncertain relations. We then present algorithms and complexity results for three fundamental problems with respect to FDs over ordinary and uncertain relations: (1) <i>Testing</i> whether a relation instance satisfies an FD; (2) <i>Finding</i> all FDs satisfied by a relation instance; and (3) <i>Inferring</i> all FDs that hold in the result of a query over uncertain relations with FDs. Finally, we look at keys as a special case of FDs, and briefly consider uncertain data that contains <i>confidence</i> values.",

    "abstract": "The advent of database services has resulted in privacy concerns on the part of the client storing data with third party database service providers. Previous approaches to enabling such a service have been based on data encryption, causing a large overhead in query processing. A distributed architecture for secure database services is proposed as a solution to this problem where data was stored at multiple sites. The distributed architecture provides both privacy as well as fault tolerance to the client. In this paper we provide algorithms for (1)distributing data: our results include hardness of approximation results and hence a heuristic greedy hill climbing algorithm for the distribution problem (2) partitioning the query at the client to queries for the various sites is done by a bottom up state based algorithm we provide. Finally the results at the sites are integrated to obtain the answer at the client. We provide an experimental validation and performance study of our algorithms .",

Because “exact” aggregation in uncertain databases can produce exponentially-sized results, we provide three alternatives: a <i>low</i> bound on the aggregate value, a <i>high</i> bound on the value, and the <i>expected</i> value. These variants return a single result instead of a set of possible results, and they are generally efficient to compute for both full-table and grouped aggregation queries. We provide formal definitions and semantics and a description of our implementation for single-table aggregation queries. We study the performance and scalability of our algorithms through experiments over a large synthetic data set. We also provide some preliminary results on aggregations over joins.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing query results with confidence values in <i>ULDBs</i>: relational databases with <i>uncertainty</i> and <i>lineage</i>. ULDBs, which subsume <i>probabilistic databases</i>, offer an alternative <i>decoupled</i> method of computing confidence values: Instead of computing confidences during query processing, compute them afterwards based on lineage. This approach enables a wider space of query plans, and it permits selective computations when not all confidence values are needed. This paper develops a suite of algorithms and optimizations for a broad class of relational queries on ULDBs. We provide confidence computation algorithms for single data items, as well as efficient batch algorithms to compute confidences for an entire relation or database. All algorithms incorporate memoization to avoid redundant computations, and they have been implemented in the <i>Trio</i> prototype ULDB database system. Performance characteristics and scalability of the algorithms are demonstrated through experimental results over a large synthetic dataset.",

    "abstract": "Information Retrieval systems such as web search engines offer convenient keyword-based search interfaces. In contrast, relational database systems require the user to learn SQL and to know the schema of the underlying data even to pose simple searches. We propose an architecture that supports highly efficient keyword-based search over relational databases: A relational database is \"crawled\" in advance, text-indexing virtual documents that correspond to interconnected database content. At query time, the text index supports keyword-based searches with instantaneous response, identifying database objects corresponding to the virtual documents matching the query. Our system, EKSO, creates virtual documents from joining relational tuples and uses the DB2 Net Search Extender for indexing and keyword-search processing. Experimental results show that index size is manageable, query response time is indeed instantaneous, and database updates (which are propagated incrementally as recomputed virtual documents to the text index) do not significantly hinder query performance. We also present a user study confirming the superiority of keyword-based search over SQL for a wide range of database retrieval tasks.",

A spectral vector is extracted near each peak, and a list of such spectral vectors forms our intermediate representation of a music piece. A database of such intermediate representations is constructed, and two pieces are matched against each other based on a specially-defined distance function.

    "abstract": "We present WSQ/DSQ (pronounced \"wisk-disk\"), a new approach for combining the query facilities of traditional databases with existing search engines on the Web. WSQ, for Web-Supported (Database) Queries, leverages results from Web searches to enhance SQL queries over a relational database. DSQ, for Database-Supported (Web) Queries, uses information stored in the database to enhance and explain Web searches. This paper focuses primarily on WSQ, describing a simple, low-overhead way to support WSQ in a relational DBMS, and demonstrating the utility of WSQ with a number of interesting queries and results. The queries supported by WSQ are enabled by two virtual tables, whose tuples represent Web search results generated dynamically during query execution. WSQ query execution may involve many high-latency calls to one or more search engines, during which the query processor is idle. We present a lightweight technique called asynchronous iteration that can be integrated easily into a standard sequential query processor to enable concurrency between query processing and multiple Web search requests. Asynchronous iteration has broader applications than WSQ alone, and it opens up many interesting query optimization issues. We have developed a prototype implementation of WSQ by extending a DBMS with virtual tables and asynchronous iteration; performance results are reported.",

In this paper we apply this notion to search across an entire database for objects that are \"near\" other relevant objects. Proximity search enables simple \"focusing\" queries based on general relationships among objects, helpful for interactive query sessions. We view the database as a graph, with data in vertices (objects) and relationships indicated by edges. Proximity is defined based on shortest paths between objects. We have implemented a prototype search engine that uses this model to enable keyword searches over databases, and we have found it very effective for quickly finding relevant information. Computing the distance between objects in a graph stored on disk can be very expensive. Hence, we show how to build compact indexes that allow us to quickly find the distance between objects at search time. Experiments show that our algorithms are effcient and scale well.",

Yet so far, languages for querying such data are too complex for casual Web users. Further, proposed query approaches do not take advantage of the interactivity of typical Web sessions–users are proficient at iteratively refining their Web explorations. In this paper we propose a new model for interactively querying and searching semistructured databases. Users can begin with a simple keyword search, dynamically browse the structure of the result, and then submit further refining queries. Enabling this model exposes new requirements of a semistructured database that are not apparent under traditional database uses. We demonstrate the importance of efficient keyword search, structural summaries of query results, and support for inverse pointers.

In particular, users can (1) detect and browse changes in such databases using the TDIFF component, (2) store and query historical data using the CORE component, and (3) subscribe to be notified when changes of a certain kind occur, using the QSS component. We use wrapper and mediator technology from the Tsimmis project to interface with diverse data sources, and the Lore system as a store for semistructured data. The TDIFF component uses tree-differencing algorithms for detecting changes in semistructured data. The CORE component implements the Delta-OEM (DOEM) data model and the Change Lorel (Chorel) query language. The QSS component ties together a variety of change detection and change reporting mechanisms in a common framework.",

    "abstract": "Many complex and dynamic database applications such as product modeling and negotiation monitoring require a number of features that have been adopted in semantic models and databases such as active rules, constraints, inheritance, etc. Unfortunately, each feature has largely been considered in isolation. Furthermore, in a commercial negotiation, participants staking their financial well-beings will never accept a system they cannot gain a precise behavioral understanding of. We attack these problems with a rich and extensible database model, evolving databases, with a clear and precise semantics based on evolving algebras \\[5\\]. We also briefly describe a prototype implementation of the model \\[12\\]. The first contribution of this paper is a rich and extensible database model primarily aimed at capturing rapidly changing environments. We describe electronic commerce negotiation using this evolving database (EDB 1 ) that captures the state of traded products, of negotiators, and the accepted laws governing the particular negotiation. We use the term evolving to stress the extremely dynamic of a negotiation. Negotiators should be able to change the product descriptions, orders, and even protocols of negotiation on the fly (e.g., by introducing a mediator in case of Although we will focus the presentation in this paper on the singularly interesting domain of commercial negotiations, the model is clearly not limited to such applications. An EDB is built using extensible sets of domain features and entities that are described by instances of these domain features. For instance, constraint could be a domain feature and salary \\> 100K an instance for this feature.

    "abstract": "Data warehouses collect copies of information from remote sources into a single database. Since the remote data is cached at the warehouse, it appears as local relations to the users of the warehouse. To improve query response time, the warehouse administrator will often materialize views dened on the local relations to support common or complicated queries. Unfortunately, the requirement to keep the views consistent with the local relations creates additional overhead when the remote sources change. The warehouse is often kept only loosely consistent with the sources: it is periodically refreshed with changes sent from the source. When this happens, the warehouse is taken off-line until the local relations and materialized views can be updated. Clearly, the users would prefer as little down time as possible. Often the down time can be reduced by adding carefully selected materialized views or indexes to the physical schema. This paper studies how to select the sets of supporting views and of indexes to materialize to minimize the down time. We call this the view index selection (VIS) problem. We present an A\\* search based solution to the problem as well as rules of thumb. We also perform additional experiments to understand the space-time tradeoff as it applies to data warehouses.",

    "abstract": "A database history can be modeled as a (finite) sequence of instances discretely ordered by time. Similarly, the behavior of a system such as an operating system or a reactive system can be modeled by an infinite such sequence. One can view the sequence as one single database where each relation has an additional column holding the time instant of validity of each tuple. The temporal database can then be queried using standard relational calculus (first-order logic) on this \"timestamp\" representation. One may alternatively use an implicit access to time and express queries in temporal logic. It is known that these two approaches yield the same expressive power in the propositional case. Their comparison in the predicate/database context remained open. We prove here that there are first-order logic queries on the timestamp representation that are not expressible in (extended) temporal logic. The proof technique is novel and is based on communication complexity. On leave from INRIA-Rocquencourt y Work performed while on leave at INRIA-Rocquencourt.

    "abstract": "The advent of the Internet has made the illegal dissemination of copyrighted material easy. An important problem is how to automatically detect when a \"new\" digital document is \"suspiciously close\" to existing ones. The SCAM project at Stanford University has addressed this problem when there is a single registered-document database. However, in practice, text documents may appear in many autonomous databases, and one would like to discover copies without having to exhaustively search in all databases. Our approach, dSCAM, is a distributed sion of SCAM that keeps succinct metainformation about the contents of the available document databases. Given a suspicious document S, dSCAM uses its information to prune all databases that cannot contain any document that is close enough to S, and hence the search can focus on the remaining sites. We also study how to query the remaining databases so as to minimize different querying costs. We empirically study the pruning and searching schemes, using a collection of 50 databases and two sets of test documents",

    "abstract": "Data warehouses collect copies of information from remote sources into a single database. Since the remote data is cached at the warehouse, it appears as local relations to the users of the warehouse. To improve query response time, the warehouse administrator (WHA) will often materialize views defined on the local relations to support common or complicated Unfortunately, the requirement to keep the views consistent with the local relations creates additional overhead when the remote sources change. The warehouse is often kept only loosely consistent with the sources: it is periodically refreshed with changes sent from the source. When this happens, the warehouse is taken off-line until the local relations and materialized views can be updated. Clearly, the users would prefer as little down time as possible. Often the down time can be reduced by adding carefully selected materialized views or indexes to the physical schema. This paper studies how to select the sets of supporting views and of indexes to materialize to minimize the down time. We call this the view index selection (VIS) problem. We present an A\\* search based solution to the problem as well as rules of thumb. We also perform additional experiments to understand the space-time tradeoff as it applies to data warehouses.

In the research community, most approaches to solving the data integration problem are based very roughly on the following two-step process: 1. Accept a query, determine the appropriate set of information sources to answer the query, and generate the appropriate subqueries or commands for each information source. 2. Obtain results from the information sources, perform appropriate translation, filtering, and merging of the information, and return the final answer to the user or application (hereafter called the client).",

    "abstract": "Object-oriented and object-relational databases (OODB) need to be able to load the vast quantities of data that OODB users bring to them. Loading OODB data is significantly more complicated than loading relational data due to the presence of relationships, or references, in the data. In our previous work, we presented algorithms for loading new objects that only share relationships with other new objects. However, it is frequently the case that new objects need to share relationships with objects already in database. In this paper we propose using queries within the load data file to identify the existing objects and suggest using parameterized functions to designate similar queries. We then propose a novel evaluation strategy for the queries that defers evaluation until all the queries can be evaluated together. All of the instantiations of a single query function can then be treated as a join between the parameters and the collection over which the function ranges, rather than evaluated as individual queries. We implement both traditional one-query-at-a-time evaluation strategies and our new strategy in a load algorithm for the Shore persistent object repository and present a performance study showing that the new strategy is at least an order of magnitude better when there are many relationships to objects already in the database",

The method derives, from a rule condition, two new conditions that can be used in place of the original condition when a previous value (true or false) of the original condition is known. The derived conditions are generally more effcient to evaluate than the original condition because they are incremental–they replace references to entire database relations by references to delta relations, which typically are much smaller.

The resulting report (Silberschatz et al. \\[1990\\]) was instrumental in bringing to the public’s attention both the significance of prior database research and the number of challenging and important problems that lay ahead. We shall not repeat here the major points made in that report concerning the historical development of relational database systems and transaction management. Rather the reader is encouraged to consult either that report or an on-line document (Gray each of which discusses these and other historical achievements of database research. In May of 1995, a second workshop was convened to consider anew the prospects for database research, and this paper reports on our findings. 2 The following points summarize the conclusions of this forum. The database research community plays a foundational role in creating the technological infrastructure from which database advancements evolve. Next-generation database applications enabled by the explosion of digitized information over the last five years will require the solution to significant new research problems. These problems are grouped in this report into the following broad areas: support for multimedia objects, distribution of information, new database applications, workflow and transaction management, and ease of database management and use. A new research mandate for the database community is provided by the technology developments of the recent past – the explosions in hardware capability, hardware capacity, and communication (including the internet or \"web\" and mobile comm There is a heightened need for governmental and industrial support of basic data",

    "abstract": "When databases inter-operate, integrity constraints arise naturally. For example, consider a flight reservation application that multiple airline databases. Airline A reserves a block of X seats from airline B. If A sells many seats from this block, it tries to increase X. For correctness, the value of X recorded in A’s database must be the same as that recorded in B’s database; this is a simple distributed copy constraint. However, the databases in the above example are owned by independent airlines and are therefore autonomous. Typically, the database of one airline will not participate in distributed transactions with other airlines, nor will it allow other airlines to lock its data. This renders traditional constraint management techniques unusable in this scenario. Our work addresses constraint management in such autonomous and heterogeneous environments. In an autonomous environment that does not support locking and transactional primitives, it is not possible to make \"strong\" guarantees of constraint satisfaction, such as a guarantee that a constraint is always true or that transactions always read consistent data. We therefore investigate and formalize weaker notions of constraint maintenance. Using our framework it will be possible, for example, to guarantee that a constraint is satisfied provided there have been no \"recent\" updates to pertinent data, or that a constraint holds from 8am to 5pm everyday. Such weaker notions of constraint satisfaction requires modeling time, and consequently, time is explicit in our framework. Most previous work in database constraint management has focused on centralized (for e.g., \\[?\\]) or tightly-coupled and homogeneous distributed databases (for e.g., \\[1\\],",

    "abstract": "Expert database systems extend the functionality of conventional database systems by providing a facility for creating and automatically executing Condition-Action rules. While Condition-Action rules in database systems are very powerful, they also can be very diffcult to program, due to the unstructured and unpredictable nature of rule processing. We provide methods for static analysis of Condition-Action rules; our methods determine whether a given rule set is guaranteed to terminate, and whether rule execution is confluent (has a guaranteed unique final Our methods are based on previous methods for analyzing rules in active database systems. We improve considerably on the previous methods by providing analysis criteria that are much less conservative: our methods often determine that a rule set will terminate or is confluent when previous methods could not. Our improved analysis is based on a \"propagation\" algorithm, which uses a formal approach based on an extended relational algebra to accurately determine when the action of one rule can affect the condition of another. Our algebraic approach yields methods that are applicable to a broad class of expert database rule languages.",

During the second step, the query is actually evaluated at the chosen databases.

Global integrity constraints can be very useful in federated databases, but the lack of global queries, global transaction mechanisms, and global concurrency control renders traditional constraint management techniques inapplicable. This paper presents a threefold contribution to integrity constraint checking in federated databases: (1) The problem of constraint checking in a federated database environment is clearly formulated. (2) A family of protocols for constraint checking is presented. (3) The differences across protocols in the family are analyzed with respect to system requirements, properties guaranteed by the protocols, and processing and communication costs. Thus, our work yields a suite of options from which a protocol can be chosen to suit the system capabilities and integrity requirements of a particular federated database environment.",

    "abstract": "We present an optimization for integrity constraint verification in distributed databases. The optimization allows a global constraint, i.e. a constraint spanning multiple databases, to be verified by accessing data at a single database, eliminating the cost of accessing remote data. The optimization is based on an algorithm that takes as input a global constraint and data to be inserted into a local database. The algorithm produces a local condition such that if the local data satisfies this condition then, based on the previous satisfaction of the global constraint, the global constraint is still satisfied. If the local data does not satisfy the condition, then a conventional global verification procedure is required.",

A mechanism is described for identifying and resolving semantic heterogeneity while at the same time honoring the autonomy of the database components that participate in the federation. A minimal, common data model is introduced as the basis for describing sharable information, and a three-pronged facility for determining the relationships between information units (objects) is developed. Our approach serves as a basis for the sharing of related concepts through (partial) schema unification without the need for a global view of the data that is stored in the different components. The mechanism presented here can be seen in contrast with more traditional approaches such as \"integrated databases\" or \"distributed databases\".

As real-time systems evolve, their applications become more complex and require access to more data. It thus becomes necessary to manage the data in a systematic and organized fashion. Database management systems provide tools for such organization, so in recent years there has been interest in \"merging\" database and real-time technology. The resulting integrated system, which provides database operations with real-time constraints is generally called a real-time database system (RTDBS) \\[1\\]. Like a conventional database system, a RTDBS functions as a repository of data, provides effcient storage, and performs retrieval and manipulation of information. However, as a part of a real-time system, whose \"tasks\" are associated with time constraints, a RTDBS, has the added burden of ensuring some degree of confidence in meeting the system’s timing requirements. Example applications that handle large amounts of data and have stringent timing requirements include telephone switching (e.g. translating an 800 number into an actual numbradar tracking and others. Arbitrage trading, for example, involves trading commodities in different markets at different prices. Since price discrepancies are usually short-lived, automated searching and processing of large amounts of trading information are very desirable. In order to capitalize on the opportunities, buy-sell decisions have to be made promptly, often with a time constraint so that the financial overhead in performing the trade actions are well compensated by the benefit resulting from the trade. As another example, a radar surveillance system detects aircraft \"images\" or \"radar signatures\". These images ar",

For example Stanford University, through its FOLIO system, provides access to the INSPEC database of abstracts of the literature on physics, computer science, electrical engineering, etc. In this paper this database is studied by using a trace-driven simulation. We focus on physical index design, inverted index caching, and database scaling in a distributed shared-nothing system. All three issues are shown to have a strong effect on response time and throughput. Database scaling is explored in two ways. One way assumes an \"optimal\" configuration for a single host and then linearly scales the database by duplicating the host architecture as needed. The second way determines the optimal number of hosts given a fixed database size.",

In parallel and distributed database environments, for maximum autonomy it is desirable for rule processing to occur separately at each site (or noresponding to operations on data at that site. However, since rules at one site may read or modify data and interact with rules at other sites, independent rule processing at each site may be impossible or incorrect. We describe mechanisms that allow rule processing to occur separately at each site and guarantee correctness: parallel or distributed rule processing is provably equivalent to rule processing in the corresponding centralized environment. Our mechanisms include locking schemes, communication protocols, and rule restrictions. Based on a given parallel or distributed environment and desired level of transparency, the mechanisms may be combined or may be used independently.",

Such a facility allows definition of database operations that are automatically executed whenever certain conditions are met. In keeping with the set-oriented approach of relational data manipulation languages, our production rules are also set-oriented–they are triggered by sets of changes to the database and may perform sets of changes. The condition and action parts of our production rules may refer to the current state of the database as well as to the sets of changes triggering the rules. We define a syntax for production rule definition as an extension to SQL. A model of system behavior is used to give an exact semantics for production rule execution, taking into account externally-generated operations, selftriggering rules, and simultaneous triggering of multiple rules.",

The parsing-based semantics is often used to override the traditional ?bag-of-words? semantics in web search and enterprise search scenarios. Compared to the ?bag-of-words? semantics, the parsing-based semantics is richer and more customizable. While a formalism for parsing-based semantics for keyword search has been proposed in prior work and ad-hoc implementations exist, the problem of designing ef?cient algorithms to support the semantics is largely unstudied. In this paper, we present a suite of ef?cient algorithms and auxiliary indexes for this problem. Our algorithms work for a broad classes of grammars used in practice, and cover a variety of database matching functions (set- and substring-containment, approximate and exact equality) and scoring functions to ?lter and rank different parses. We formally analyze the running time complexity of our algorithms and provide a thorough empirical evaluation over real-world data to show that our algorithms scale well with the size of the database and grammar",
