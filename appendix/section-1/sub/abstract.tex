I use William Brent's \obj{timbreID} ---timbre description algorithms--- and Antoine Villeret's \linebreak \obj{pix\_opencv} ---image descriptors using Computer Vision algorithms---, to develop a new software library for Pure Data. My model consists of a joint Database structure for Image and Audio descriptors suitable for realtime navigation. At its core, the Database is generated by calculating derivatives between both data sets, and it is performed by applying random probabilities, markov chains, or chaotic generators to this navigation. This allows for multiple paths to be traced on each navigation.
