In order to write this dissertation, I have developed ``Abby'' an online Text Database tool namely to build an annotated bibliography. The program is mostly written in Javascript, with the data navigation and programming hosted in Github, and the datasets stored in the Google account that New York University has provided me. The annotated bibliography is available at \url{https://fdch.github.io/abby}, and the code can be accessed or cloned from \url{https://github.com/fdch/litrev}.
