They remain seated. Viola should be able to sit behind the audience, with enough room to stand up and move around. Two speakers must be placed behind the violins, and the stereo must be audible. The room should remain dark the whole time, except for stopwatches that illuminate the players. If stopwatches have no light, there should be individual, portable lights facing each player. Relations last 15- 30 seconds long. The whole piece should last around 13 minutes. The players -and not the electroacoustic track- must end the piece.
