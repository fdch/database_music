{Immersed on a digital environment, ``untitled2'' lives on the limit between field recording and synthesis, music composition and sound art. This liminality aims to resonate its way into the complex difference between art and life. It was composed and premiered during the ``Delian Academy for New Music'' held in Mikonos, Greece, in June 2018}

\section*{Program Notes}
{This interactive, audio/visual installation simulates the process by which the human brain perceives the world. From a mechanical point of view, it has been suggested that the human brain is a machine that performs an inverse Fourier Transform through which it constructs a geometric image from correlations of reflections of light. While a significant component of the installation is visual, the audio acts via sonification to extend the perception beyond just what the eye can see. The audience is invited to experience spectral properties outside of the more familiar visible wavelengths. This piece simultaneously addresses that the mechanical component of perception, even when perceiving one's own self, is only a part of a complex process shaped by many external stimuli, one of the strongest being societal. Authors: Lucia D Simonelli, Matias G Delgadino, Hally, Fede Camara Halac}

\section*{Program Notes}
{Ciudad Invertida / Inverted City is a work that seeks to raise questions about chance and interactivity in the multiplicity of the media involved, in relation to inverted images of systems that emerge from the concert experience. Performers read with hyperreal accuracy a hand-written proportional score composed with an essentially incorrect implementation of a zero order markov chain (i.e. an expressionistic interpolation of absurdly distributed Puckette-PRNG sequences). The live signal from one performer triggers sample capturingand resynthesis of the other performer (and viceversa), while also triggering images and image transformations projected over the body of both performers. This work is made completely with puredata and GEM, with one pre-recorded soundscape and 1025 abstracted images that were taken in transit, from vantage points and in different locations of the city of Cordoba, Argentina. The work was premiered in Cordoba during the B3CIM (2015) and it was given a NY premiere during the PdCon16\url{~} (2016) by Rage Thormbones.}
